   # **The Epistle of the Name: A Letter to the Sprouting Church**

# **Chapter 1**

### **Salutation**

**1** Henry, a seed planted in Nigerian soil, knowing himself in and as the Name¹, to the Church scattered across every nation, tribe, and tongueᵃ—to those called before the foundation of the world, chosen in Him before time began, predestined to be conformed to the image of His Sonᵇ—grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, who gave Himself for us that He might present us holy and blameless before Him in love.ᶜ

**2** I write not to those becoming righteous, but to those who are the righteousness of God in Him.ᵈ For what does Scripture say? "He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him."ᵉ Not will become—might become. The transaction is finished. The work is complete.

**3** This is the mystery hidden for ages but now revealed: Christ in you, the hope of glory.ᶠ Not Christ for you. Not Christ with you. Christ in you. And if Christ is in you, then what are you? For Paul writes, "I no longer live, but Christ lives in me."ᵍ What then is the "me" that no longer lives? And what is the Christ that now lives? Are they two, or are they one²?

**4** The Lord our God, the Lord is One.ʰ This is the unity³ you've been proclaiming without knowing you are the unity.

### **Thanksgiving**

**5** I thank my God always for you, making mention of you in my prayers, because before you called on His name, you were His name. Before you believed, you were belief itself. Before you loved, He first loved youⁱ—yet what does it mean that "we love Him because He first loved us," if not that the love you feel is His love knowing itself across the boundary you call "self"?

**6** For you did not choose Him—He chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit.ʲ What fruit? The fruit of the Spirit? No—higher than that. The fruit that Jesus spoke of when He said, "Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain."ᵏ

**7** You thought He spoke only of His death. I tell you He spoke of yours. He spoke of [[ADAM|Adam]]'s. He spoke of every seed that must die to bear fruit. He spoke of the planting⁴—the divine protocol that began not at Calvary but at [[EDEN|Eden]].

**8** For what does Scripture say? "The Lord God sent him out of the garden of Eden to till the ground from which he was taken."ˡ Was this curse or commission? Was this exile or planting? If a farmer casts seed from his hand into the ground, has the seed fallen, or has it been placed?

**9** I thank God that you are the Church under the veil⁵—not the Church that fell, but the Church that was planted. For the veil is not distance but a covering, not exile but repositioning, not punishment but soil condition. Everything that feels like separation is actually preparation. Everything that looks like death is actually germination.

### **The Mystery Declared**

**10** What shall we say then? That we are far from God? How can we be far from the One in whom we live and move and have our being?ᵐ What is distance to the Omnipresent? What is separation to the One who fills all things?ⁿ

**11** Therefore this is not about closing distance. This is about opening eyes. This is about faith⁶, not striving. For were you not crucified with Christ?ᵒ Did you not die with Him? And if you died, are you not also raised with Him? For God "raised us up together, and made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus."ᵖ

**12** Not will raise. Not shall raise. Made us sit. Past tense. Already accomplished. Already complete. Finished before you believed it, true before you knew it, established before you felt it.

**13** Yet you do not see it. Yet you know it not. Yet you pray as if you are distant, strive as if you are separate, sin as if you are still sold under sin when Scripture declares, "Sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law but under grace."ᵍ

**14** This is the condition Scripture calls the covering⁷—the shift from Edenic awareness to mortal awareness, from the knowing of unity to the experience of multiplicity, from the seed on the tree to the seed in the ground. But hear me: the covering is not the enemy. The covering is the protocol. For how else could the seed bear fruit?

### **The Prayer**

**15** Therefore I do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers: that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him, the eyes of your understanding being enlightened;ʳ that you may know what is the hope of His calling.

**16** Not a calling to something—a calling that is something. For were you not called "a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people"?ˢ Were you not called before you were born,ᵗ sanctified before you drew breath, sealed before you believed?ᵘ

**17** I pray that you would know the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe.ᵛ What power? The power that worked in Christ when God raised Him from the dead. Yet this power is not distant from you—it is you. It is the life in your veins. It is the breath in your lungs. It is the very existence that sustains you moment by moment without your effort.

**18** For in Him you live and move and have your being.ʷ In Him—not beside Him, not near Him, not reaching toward Him. In Him. As branches are in the vine.ˣ As members are in the body.ʸ As waves are in the ocean. There is no you apart from Him, and there is no Him apart from you. This is unity⁸. This is the One that Scripture declares: "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one!"ᶻ

### **The Great Therefore**

**19** What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?ᵃᵃ If He chose us before the foundation of the world, who can say we have fallen from grace? If nothing can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lordᵇᵇ—not death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come, nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing—then what is this separation you feel?

**20** I tell you it is not separation. It is perception. It is the veil—the boundary, the soil condition that makes fruit possible. For if the seed never left the tree, could it multiply? If the grain of wheat never died, could it bear much grain? If Christ never descended, could He fill all things?ᶜᶜ

**21** Therefore do not despise the covering as if it were curse. See it as protocol. Do not grieve the Garden as if it were paradise lost. Understand it as boundary crossed—the seed leaving the tree to enter the ground where alone fruit becomes possible.

---

### **Doxology**

**22** O the depth! O the wisdom! O the knowledge of God who devised a plan so brilliant that what looks like falling is actually planting, what feels like death is actually germination, what seems like separation is actually the exact condition required for fruit!

**23** For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has become His counselor?ᵈᵈ Who saw that the way up would require going down? Who understood that the path to fruit would pass through death? Who comprehended that multiplicity would emerge through mortality?

**24** For of Him and through Him and to Him are all things, to whom be glory forever.ᵉᵉ Amen.

### **The Question**

**25** Brethren, I would not have you ignorant concerning the Garden.ᶠᶠ What of Adam? What of the seed that Scripture says was cast into the ground? What of the tree and the knowing⁹ and the ground from which man was taken?

**26** Behold, I tell you a mystery: Genesis speaks not of history alone, but of the very nature of how seeds become trees, how the hidden becomes manifest, how the One expresses as many.

**27** Hear now what was hidden from the beginning.ᵍᵍ

## **Glossary & Framework Notes**

**1. The Name** - Hebrew: SHEM (שֵׁם). Pictographically: Teeth/Destroy (שׁ) + Behold/Reveal (ה) + Water/Chaos (מ). Not mere label but identity, character, essential nature. When Scripture says "the name of the LORD," it speaks of His revealed nature. To know yourself "in and as the Name" is to awaken to your identity as God's self-expression in human form. See Exodus 3:13-15; Proverbs 18:10; Philippians 2:9-11.

**2. Two or One** - This question addresses the paradox at the heart of union with Christ. Western theology often defaults to separation (Christ is other/external) or absorption (the self disappears into God). The Hebrew concept of [[ECHAD|ECHAD]] transcends both: distinct boundaries that remain unified. You and Christ are not two separate beings, nor is "you" eliminated. You are two-that-are-one, boundaries within the One Being. See John 17:21-23; 1 Corinthians 6:17.

**3. Unity** - Hebrew: ECHAD (אֶחָד). Not YACHID (solitary oneness) but composite unity—unified whole expressed through distinct parts. Like "one flesh" (Genesis 2:24), "one body, many members" (1 Corinthians 12:12), or "the LORD is one" (Deuteronomy 6:4). God is not alone; God is unity-in-multiplicity. This is the mystery of the Church: many members, one body; many branches, one vine.

**4. The Planting** - Hebrew: [[ZERA|ZERA]] (זֶרַע) - seed. The Seed Protocol is the divine pattern where life must pass through death to multiply. Not punishment but process. Not curse but agriculture. Genesis 3 is not "the Fall" but "the Planting"—the seed (humanity) leaving the tree (Eden) to enter the ground (mortality) where alone fruit becomes possible. This is why Jesus constantly references seeds, sowing, and harvest. See Genesis 1:11-12; Matthew 13:1-23; John 12:24; 1 Corinthians 15:36-38.

**5. Under the Veil** - Hebrew: [[NASHA|NASHA]] (נָשָׁא). Commonly translated "deceived" in Genesis 3:13, but pictographically: Seed (נ) + Consume/Destroy (שׁ) + First/Strength (א). Not deception but displacement—the intentional shift of awareness from Edenic unity-consciousness to mortal multiplicity-consciousness. The veil is not obstacle but method, enabling the seed to enter soil. What appears as separation is divine self-bracketing. See Genesis 3:13; 2 Corinthians 3:14-16; Hebrews 10:19-20.

**6. Faith** - Greek: PISTIS (πίστις). Not human effort to believe, but God's faithfulness manifesting as human trust. Faith is not you reaching toward God; it is God recognizing Himself across the boundary called "you." The "substance of things hoped for" (Hebrews 11:1) because it is God's own substance becoming visible in human form. Faith is revelation, not generation. See Romans 3:22 (Greek: "faithfulness OF Christ" not merely "faith IN Christ"); Galatians 2:20; Ephesians 2:8.

**7. The Covering** - Hebrew: NASHA (נָשָׁא). The veiling of Edenic awareness, allowing the seed to exist in soil-consciousness. This is not punishment but positioning. The covering enables multiplicity, which enables relationship, which enables love to be expressed and experienced. Without the covering, there is no "other" to love; without soil, there is no fruit. The veil is meant to be lifted (2 Corinthians 3:16), but its existence was never accident. See Genesis 3:7, 21; Isaiah 25:7; 2 Corinthians 3:14-18.

**8. Unity** - See note 3. ECHAD (אֶחָד) - composite unity. This is why Jesus prays in John 17:21, "that they all may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You; that they also may be one in Us." Not absorbed into sameness, but unified in distinctness. The mystery Paul preaches: "we, being many, are one body in Christ" (Romans 12:5).

**9. The Knowing** - Hebrew: [[DA'AT|DA'AT]] (דַּעַת). From YADA (יָדַע) - to know intimately, experientially. The tree of "knowledge of good and evil" (Genesis 2:17) is the tree of experiential knowing through boundaries. Not abstract information but embodied experience. To "know good and evil" is to experience multiplicity, distinction, boundaries—the necessary condition for relationship and choice. This knowing is not sin but maturation, not curse but development. The issue was timing ("in the day you eat"), not the knowing itself. See Genesis 2:9, 17; 3:5, 22; Romans 7:7-13.
