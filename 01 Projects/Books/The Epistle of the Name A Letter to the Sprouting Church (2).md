   # **The Epistle of the Name: A Letter to the Sprouting Church**

# **Chapter 1**

### **Salutation**

**1** Henry, a seed planted in Nigerian soil, knowing himself IN and AS the Name, to the Church scattered across every nation, tribe, and tongue—to those called before the foundation of the worldᵃ, chosen in Him before time began, predestined to be conformed to the image of His Sonᵇ—grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, who gave Himself for us that He might present us holy and blameless before Him in loveͨ.

**2** I write not to those becoming righteous, but to those who ARE the righteousness of God in Him. For what does Scripture say? "He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him."ᵈ Not will become—MIGHT BECOME. The exchange¹ is finished. The work is complete.

**3** This is the mystery hidden for ages but now revealed: Christ in you, the hope of glory.ᵉ Not Christ FOR you. Not Christ WITH you. Christ IN you. And if Christ is in you, then what are you? For Paul writes, "I no longer live, but Christ lives in me."ᶠ What then is the "me" that no longer lives? And what is the Christ that now lives? Are they two, or are they one²?

**4** The Lord our God, the Lord is One.ᵍ This is the Name you've been calling without knowing you ARE the Name.

### **Thanksgiving**

**5** I thank my God always for you, making mention of you in my prayers, because before you called on His name, you WERE His name³. Before you believed, you were belief itself. Before you loved, He first loved youʰ—yet what does it mean that "we love Him because He first loved us,"ⁱ if not that the love you feel is His love knowing itself across the boundary you call "self"?

**6** For you did not choose Him—He chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit.ʲ What fruit? The fruit of the Spirit? No—higher than that. The fruit that Jesus spoke of when He said, "Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain."ᵏ

**7** You thought He spoke only of His death. I tell you He spoke of yours. He spoke of [[ADAM|Adam]]'s. He spoke of every seed that must die to bear fruit. He spoke of the planting⁴—the way of the seed that began not at Calvary but at [[EDEN|Eden]].

**8** For what does Scripture say? "The Lord God sent him out of the garden of Eden to till the ground from which he was taken."ˡ Was this curse or commission? Was this exile or planting? If a farmer casts seed from his hand into the ground, has the seed fallen, or has it been placed?

**9** I thank God that you are the Church under the veil⁵—not the Church that fell, but the Church that was planted. For the veil is not distance but displacement, not exile but repositioning, not punishment but soil condition. Everything that feels like separation is actually preparation. Everything that looks like death is actually germination.

### **The Mystery Declared**

**10** What shall we say then? That we are far from God? How can we be far from the One in whom we live and move and have our being?ᵐ What is distance to the Omnipresent? What is farness to the One who fills all things?ⁿ

**11** Therefore this is not about closing distance. This is about opening eyes. This is about faith⁶ as seeing, not striving. For were you not crucified with Christ?ᵒ Did you not die with Him? And if you died, are you not also raised with Him? For God "raised us up together, and made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus."ᵖ

**12** Not will raise. Not shall raise. MADE us sit. Past tense. Already accomplished. Already complete. Finished before you believed it, true before you knew it, established before you felt it.

**13** Yet you do not see it. Yet your eyes remain veiled. Yet you pray as if you are distant, strive as if you are separate, sin as if you are still sold under sin when Scripture declares, "Sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law but under grace."ᑫ

**14** This is the condition of the veil⁵—the mind shifted from Eden's awareness to mortal awareness, from the knowing of unity⁷ to the experience of multiplicity, from the seed on the tree to the seed in the ground. But hear me: the veil is not the enemy. The veil is the method. For how else could the seed bear fruit?

### **The Prayer**

**15** Therefore I do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers: that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him, the eyes of your understanding being enlightened;ʳ that you may know what is the hope of His calling.

**16** Not a calling TO something—a calling that IS something⁸. For were you not called "a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people"?ˢ Were you not called before you were born,ᵗ sanctified before you drew breath, sealed before you believed?ᵘ

**17** I pray that you would know the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe.ᵛ What power? The power that worked in Christ when God raised Him from the dead. Yet this power is not distant from you—it IS you. It is the life in your veins. It is the breath in your lungs. It is the very existence that sustains you moment by moment without your effort.

**18** For in Him you live and move and have your being.ᵐ In Him—not beside Him, not near Him, not reaching toward Him. IN Him. As branches are in the vine.ʷ As members are in the body.ˣ As waves are in the ocean. There is no you apart from Him, and there is no Him expressing apart from you. This is the One²—the unity that Scripture declares: "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one!"ᵍ

### **The Great Therefore**

**19** What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?ʸ If He chose us before the foundation of the world, who can say we have fallen from grace? If nothing can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord—not death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come, nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing—then what is this separation you feel?

**20** I tell you it is not separation. It is the veil—the boundary⁹, the soil condition that makes fruit possible. For if the seed never left the tree, could it multiply? If the grain of wheat never died, could it bear much grain?ᵏ If Christ never descended, could He fill all things?ᵃᵃ

**21** Therefore do not despise the veil as if it were curse. Understand it as method. Do not grieve the Garden as if it were paradise lost. See it as boundary crossed—the seed leaving the tree to enter the ground where alone fruit becomes possible.

---

### **Doxology**

**22** O the depth! O the wisdom! O the knowledge of God who devised a plan so brilliant that what looks like exile is actually planting, what feels like death is actually germination, what seems like separation is actually the exact condition required for fruit!

**23** For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has become His counselor?ᵃᵇ Who saw that the way UP would require going DOWN? Who understood that the path to fruit would pass through death? Who comprehended that multiplicity would emerge through mortality?

**24** For of Him and through Him and to Him are all things, to whom be glory forever. Amen.ᵃͨ

### **The Question That Opens All**

**25** Brethren, I would not have you ignorant concerning the Garden. What then of Adam? What of the tree? What of the seed that Scripture says was cast into the ground?

**26** Behold, I tell you a mystery¹⁰: Genesis speaks not only of what happened once, but of what is always happening. The Garden is not only a place—it is a boundary. Adam is not only a man—he is the seed. The planting is not only an event—it is the eternal pattern by which the Invisible becomes visible, by which the One becomes many, by which God knows Himself through the mirror of creation.

**27** Hear then what has been hidden from the beginning but is now made plain to those whose eyes are opened.ᵃᵈ

#### Framework Notes (Numbers)

**1. The Exchange** - What theology calls "the Great Exchange" or "double imputation": Christ takes our sin, we receive His righteousness. But this is not transaction between separate parties—it is God reconciling Himself to Himself across the boundary of human flesh. The exchange reveals what was always true: that humanity IS the righteousness of God, veiled only by the necessary condition Paul calls "the flesh" and we call [[NASHA|NASHA]].

**2. One** - Hebrew: [[ECHAD|ECHAD]] (אֶחָד). Pictographically: Strong Leader (א) + Fence/Door (ח) + Door (ד). Not solitary unity (YACHID) but composite unity—the unified whole expressed through distinct parts. Like "the two shall become one flesh" (Genesis 2:24) or "one body with many members" (1 Corinthians 12:12-27). The mystery Paul declares—"Christ in you"—is ECHAD: God and humanity are not two seeking to become one, but the One expressing as two, learning to see itself as one.

**3. Before You Called, You Were His Name** - The Name (Hebrew: SHEM, שֵׁם) is not vocabulary but identity. When God calls Abraham "Abraham" (Genesis 17:5), He is not renaming but revealing what Abraham has always been: "father of many nations." So with you—before you knew to call on the Name of the Lord, you WERE that Name. Your existence is God speaking Himself. Your identity is His identity taking particular form. This is what it means that we are "called by His name" (2 Chronicles 7:14; Isaiah 43:7).

**4. The Planting** - Hebrew: The Seed Protocol. Genesis 3 is not the story of a fall but of a planting. Just as a farmer casts seed from his hand into the ground (it "falls" only from the seed's perspective, but is "placed" from the farmer's perspective), so God cast humanity into mortality—not as punishment but as process. The seed must leave the tree, enter the ground, die to its seed-form, and sprout into tree-form. This is not failure but protocol. See John 12:24; 1 Corinthians 15:36-38.

**5. The Veil** - Hebrew: NASHA (נָשָׁא). Pictographically: Seed (נ) + Consume/Destroy (שׁ) + First/Strength (א). Traditionally translated "deceived" in Genesis 3:13, but the pictographic meaning reveals: the seed (humanity) consumed/transformed by the serpent's word (God's word through the boundary called "serpent"), resulting in a shift from first-awareness (Edenic consciousness of unity) to multiplicity-awareness (mortal consciousness of separation). This is not deception but designed displacement—the covering that enables the Seed Protocol. Paul calls it "the veil" (2 Corinthians 3:14-16), Moses experienced it (Exodus 34:33-35), and Christ tore it (Matthew 27:51)—not to destroy the boundary but to reveal that the boundary was always God's method of self-expression.

**6. Faith as Seeing** - Greek: PISTIS (πίστις), typically translated "faith" or "belief," but rooted in the concept of conviction based on what is seen or known. Hebrews 11:1 defines it: "the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." Faith is not generating belief to manipulate God into acting. Faith is God recognizing Himself across boundaries—the Infinite seeing the Infinite through finite eyes. This is why Jesus could say, "When you see me, you see the Father" (John 14:9). Faith is divine self-recognition.

**7. Unity** - The Edenic state was not perfection achieved but unity experienced—Adam knowing himself as expression of God, not separate entity approaching God. The tree of knowledge of good and evil introduced the awareness of duality (good/evil, self/other, God/human), which is the necessary condition for fruit. You cannot bear fruit as long as you know yourself only as the tree. The seed must "forget" it is the tree in order to become a tree. This forgetting is the veil (NASHA), and this remembering is what we call salvation.

**8. A Calling That IS Something** - The Greek word for "called" (KLETOS, κλητός) means "invited" but carries the weight of identity, not just invitation. When God "calls" you, He is not inviting you to become something—He is declaring what you already are. "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; before you were born I sanctified you" (Jeremiah 1:5). The calling does not create the identity; it reveals it. You are not called TO sonship; you are called because you ARE sons (Galatians 4:6-7).

**9. The Boundary** - Every boundary in Scripture is not obstacle but method. The veil in the temple separated Holy of Holies from outer court—not to keep God distant but to create the condition for priesthood, sacrifice, intercession. When Christ tore the veil, He did not destroy the boundary—He revealed that WE are the boundary, the place where God meets God, the mercy seat where divinity reconciles with itself across the separation called "human." See Hebrews 10:19-20; Ephesians 2:14.

**10. A Mystery** - Greek: MYSTERION (μυστήριον). Not "mysterious" in the sense of unknowable, but "mystery" in the sense of hidden truth now revealed. Paul uses this word repeatedly: the mystery of Christ (Ephesians 3:4), the mystery of the gospel (Ephesians 6:19), the mystery of God's will (Ephesians 1:9), the mystery hidden for ages (Colossians 1:26). Each time, he means: what was always true but only now being unveiled. Genesis has always contained the Seed Protocol. It was hidden in plain sight, waiting for eyes to see.
