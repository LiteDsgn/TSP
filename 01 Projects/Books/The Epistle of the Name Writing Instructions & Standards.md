# **The Epistle of the Name: Writing Instructions & Standards**

## **Project Overview**

**Title:** The Epistle of the Name: A Letter to the Sprouting Church

**Format:** Epistolary (letter format like Paul's epistles)

**Structure:** 8 chapters, numbered verses throughout for memorization and citation

**Purpose:** Awaken the Church to identity consciousness using biblical language as the vehicle for TSP (The Seed Protocol) framework revelation

---

## **Core Writing Principles**

### **1. Epistolary Format (Letter Style)**

- This is a LETTER, not a treatise or systematic theology textbook
    
- Write as if speaking directly to real people Henry knows and loves
    
- Use Paul and John's epistolary structure:
    

- Salutation (greeting + theological anchor)
    
- Thanksgiving/Prayer section
    
- Main theological content
    
- Practical application
    
- Personal exhortations
    
- Closing benediction
    

- No academic distance - maintain warmth, urgency, pastoral care
    
- This is ONE LONG LETTER divided into chapters for reading ease (like Bible epistles)
    

### **2. Sound Like Scripture, Not Like Philosophy**

- **Short, punchy, declarative sentences** - not long explanatory paragraphs
    
- **Proclamation, not explanation** - declare truth, don't teach a class
    
- **Hebrew parallelism** - repeat ideas in slightly different ways (Psalms/Proverbs style)
    
- **Minimal meta-commentary** - don't explain what you're doing, just do it
    
- **Grounded in Scripture** - every major claim anchored in biblical text
    
- **Natural flow** - no artificial section breaks or preview statements
    

### **3. Pauline/Johannine Writing Style Elements**

#### **A. Explosive Opening Moves**

- Pack theological density into the first few verses
    
- Don't ease in - detonate the main thesis immediately
    
- Use long, breathless sentences when appropriate (like Paul's Greek)
    

#### **B. Rhetorical Question Barrage**

Use frequently throughout:

- "What then shall we say?"
    
- "Know ye not...?"
    
- "How can we...?"
    
- "Who shall...?"
    
- "What? Do you not know...?"
    

#### **C. Logical Connectors**

Heavy use of:

- "Therefore..."
    
- "For..." (because)
    
- "Yet..."
    
- "But..."
    
- "So then..."
    

#### **D. Doxology Mid-Letter**

Break into spontaneous worship when theology overwhelms:

- "O the depth!"
    
- "O the wisdom!"
    
- "To Him be glory forever. Amen."
    

#### **E. Mystical Paradox**

Like John - state paradoxes without immediate resolution:

- "The Word was with God, and the Word was God"
    
- "I live, yet not I, but Christ lives in me"
    
- Comfortable with mystery, not rushing to explain
    

#### **F. Transitional Phrases**

Use biblical language for transitions:

- "Behold, I tell you a mystery..."
    
- "I would not have you ignorant..."
    
- "Brethren, hear this..."
    
- "Consider..."
    
- "It is written..."
    
- "The Scripture says..."

## **Language & Terminology Standards**

### **1. Use Biblical Terms, Not Modern Spiritual Language**

**AVOID (New Age/Modern):**

- "Consciousness" / "consciousness shift"
    
- "Recognition" / "recognize"
    
- "Christ-consciousness"
    
- "Awareness"
    
- "Enlightenment"
    
- "Awakening" (use sparingly, only if biblical)
    

**USE INSTEAD (Biblical):**

- **Mind** (Romans 12:2 - "renewed mind")
    
- **Understanding** (Ephesians 1:18 - "eyes of your understanding")
    
- **Spirit** / "spiritually minded" (Romans 8:6)
    
- **Heart** (Hebrews 4:12)
    
- **Inner man** (Ephesians 3:16)
    
- **Faith** (Hebrews 11:1)
    
- **Revelation** (Ephesians 1:17)
    
- **Seeing** (John 9:25 - "I was blind, now I see")
    
- **Knowing** (Philippians 3:10)
    
- **Eyes opened** (Luke 24:31)
    
- **The veil lifted** (2 Corinthians 3:16)
    

### **2. Hebrew Terms in Footnotes, Not Main Text**

**Main text uses natural English**. Footnotes introduce Hebrew depth.

**Example:**

**Main Text:**

> "You are the Church under the veil¹, planted in mortal soil."

**Footer:**

> ¹ **The Veil** - Hebrew: [[NASHA|NASHA]] (נָשָׁא). Pictographically: Seed (נ) + Consume (שׁ) + First (א). Not deception or fall, but the intentional covering of Edenic awareness—consciousness shifted from unity to multiplicity, enabling the Seed Protocol. See Genesis 3:13; 2 Corinthians 3:14-16.

**Do NOT write in main text:**

> "You are the Church in NASHA, planted in mortal soil."

**English equivalents for Hebrew terms:**

- **NASHA** → "the veil," "the covering," "the planting," "the displacement"
    
- **[[ECHAD|ECHAD]]** → "the One," "unity," "composite unity," "the Lord is One"
    
- **Seed Protocol** → "the planting," "the sowing," "the way of the seed," "the pattern of death and fruit"
    
- **[[YESH|YESH]]** → "being," "existence," "substance"
    
- **The Planting** → "the sowing," "when the seed entered the ground," "the descent into mortality"

## **Scripture Reference System**

### **Alpha-Numeric Coding**

#### **Letters (a, b, c) = Cross-References**

Point to related Scripture passages

**Format:**

> "For God raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly placesᵃ in Christ."

**Footer:**

> ᵃ Ephesians 2:6; Colossians 3:1-3; Romans 6:4-5

#### **Numbers (1, 2, 3) = TSP Framework Notes**

Introduce glossary terms, Hebrew insights, or framework clarifications

**Format:**

> "We are not many seeking One. We are the One¹ expressing as many."

**Footer:**

> ¹ **The One** - Hebrew: ECHAD (אֶחָד). Not solitary unity (YACHID) but composite unity—the unified whole expressed through distinct parts. Like "one flesh" (Genesis 2:24) or "one body, many members" (1 Corinthians 12:12). This is the mystery of "the Lord our God, the Lord is One" (Deuteronomy 6:4).

### **How to Reference Scripture**

**When quoting directly:**

- Use "It is written..."
    
- Use "The Scripture says..."
    
- Use "Moses said..." / "David said..." / "Isaiah wrote..."
    
- Use "Have ye not read...?"
    

**Don't always cite chapter/verse inline** (they didn't exist in apostolic era) - name the source or book, put precise reference in footnote

**Example:**

> "For it is written in the Psalms, 'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand'ᵃ"

**Footer:**

> ᵃ Psalm 110:1; quoted in Matthew 22:44; Acts 2:34; Hebrews 1:13

## **Verse Numbering Standards**

### **Purpose of Numbering**

- Enable memorization
    
- Allow precise citation ("Name 1:22")
    
- Make the text quotable like Scripture
    
- Each verse should be a complete thought unit that can stand alone while flowing into the next
    

### **Verse Length Guidelines**

- Generally 1-3 sentences per verse
    
- Can be longer for opening salutations or doxologies (like Paul's long Greek sentences)
    
- Break at natural thought boundaries
    
- Keep rhythm and flow in mind
    

---

## **What NOT to Do**

### **1. No Preview Statements**

**AVOID:**

- "I will show you that..."
    
- "In the following chapters..."
    
- "What I will demonstrate..."
    
- "Let me now explain..."
    

**INSTEAD:**

- Just transition naturally
    
- Use "Behold..." or "Hear this..." if you must signal a shift
    
- Let chapters flow into each other organically
    

### **2. No Academic Tone**

**AVOID:**

- "It is important to note that..."
    
- "We must understand that..."
    
- "The theological significance of this is..."
    
- "From a hermeneutical perspective..."
    

**INSTEAD:**

- Direct proclamation
    
- Rhetorical questions
    
- Pastoral urgency
    

### **3. No Explanation Cushions**

**AVOID:**

- "What I mean by this is..."
    
- "In other words..."
    
- "To put it another way..."
    
- "Let me clarify..."
    

**INSTEAD:**

- State it once, clearly
    
- Use parallelism to restate if needed
    
- Trust the reader
    

### **4. No Over-Formatting**

- Don't use section headers within chapters (just verse numbers)
    
- Don't bold/italicize for emphasis (except Scripture quotes if needed)
    
- Let the words carry the weight
    

---

## **Chapter Structure Guidelines**

### **General Pattern (adaptable per chapter):**

1. **Opening declaration** (explosive theological statement)
    
2. **Scriptural grounding** (anchor in biblical text)
    
3. **Rhetorical development** (questions, paradoxes, logical progression)
    
4. **Practical implications** (what this means for their lives)
    
5. **Transition to next chapter** (natural bridge, not preview)
    

### **Natural Chapter Endings**

- **Doxology** (worship/praise)
    
- **Benediction** (grace/peace)
    
- **Transitional question** (that next chapter answers)
    
- **Summary proclamation** (declaring what's been established)
    

---

## **The Balance: Love Language, Revolutionary Content**

### **The Strategy**

- **Use familiar biblical language** (the vehicle) to deliver **radical TSP revelation** (the payload)
    
- This is **pastoral** (speaking in love to believers) while being **prophetic** (disrupting false frameworks)
    
- The delivery is accessible; the content is revolutionary
    

### **Why This Matters**

Henry is writing to the Church with:

- **Nigerian prophetic urgency** (direct, passionate, unashamed)
    
- **Love-driven revelation** (not condemnation)
    
- **Generational thinking** (planting seeds for those who'll understand later)
    
- **Scholarly rigor in accessible form** (Hebrew depth made pastoral)
    

The goal: **Identity awakening, not behavior modification**

---

## **Tone Calibration**

### **Sound Like:**

- Paul in Romans (theological density + pastoral warmth)
    
- John in his epistles (mystical paradox + direct address)
    
- Hebrews (ancient Scripture reinterpreted through Christ)
    

### **Don't Sound Like:**

- Academic theology textbook
    
- Self-help spiritual book
    
- New Age philosophy
    
- Corporate Christian marketing
    
- Western systematic theology lecture
    

### **Henry's Voice:**

- Nigerian without pidgin
    
- Prophetic without condemnation
    
- Intellectual without showing off
    
- Urgent without panic
    
- Loving without sentimentality

## **Quality Checkpoints**

Before finalizing any section, ask:

1. **Could this sit in the canon between Hebrews and James?** (If not, why not?)
    
2. **Does it sound like a letter to real people?** (Or like a lecture?)
    
3. **Are Hebrew terms in footnotes, not main text?** (Accessible to any Bible reader?)
    
4. **Is every major claim grounded in Scripture?** (With proper cross-references?)
    
5. **Are we using biblical vocabulary?** (Not modern spiritual language?)
    
6. **Does it flow naturally?** (Or are there artificial breaks/previews?)
    
7. **Is it proclamation or explanation?** (We want proclamation.)
    
8. **Would Paul recognize this as an epistle?** (Structure, tone, urgency?)

## **Technical Specifications**

### **File Format**

- Markdown (.md)
    
- Clear chapter divisions
    
- Verse numbers in bold
    
- Footnotes at bottom of each chapter
    
- Cross-references and framework notes clearly distinguished
    

### **Citation Format**

**Cross-references (letters):**

> ᵃ Ephesians 2:6; Colossians 3:1-3; Romans 6:4-5

**Framework notes (numbers):**

> ¹ **Term/Concept** - Hebrew: [word]. Pictographic meaning. TSP framework explanation. Relevant cross-references.

## **Remember: This is a LETTER**

Not a book. Not a treatise. Not a systematic theology.

A letter from Henry to the Church he loves, written with:

- Apostolic authority (speaking what's been revealed)
    
- Pastoral tenderness (knowing their struggles)
    
- Prophetic urgency (this generation needs to hear it)
    
- Generational vision (planting for future harvest)
    

Every verse should sound like **Scripture commenting on Scripture**, delivered with **love-driven passion** in service of **identity revelation**.
