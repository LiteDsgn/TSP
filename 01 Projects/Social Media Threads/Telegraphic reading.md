Telegraphic reading...

  

That thou mayest deal wisely in the way of your life.

  

Sometimes, it seems like we do not connect with people

  

Ps 119:97

  

Meditation happens all day. It goes beyond setting aside time to do it. It means setting your mind aside to think upon the word

  

The word if God develops my ability :

  

To respond to things

to understand things

  

Foolish means to be thoughtless in the Hebrew

  

One can be foolish even when mature, it means one is not receiving wisdom from the Lord. On many occasions, David said I'm wiser.

  

Prov 24:3-4. The 3 different ways knowledge was used here...

  

The concept of insight into things

the concept of wisdom, the right way to apply things

The concept of common sense

  

Joseph saves when everyone was spending... Even when Pharaoh was a good leader who had common sense that could build an enterprise, he wasn't born again.

  

The word of God comes to us for us to think on it. Not to teach it, but to change the way we thing for that would change the way we act. James 1:16-25

  

Look into the word and continue to look into the word. Engage the word more than you listen to other things. If you engage the word, you observe some minor, minute details that would change how you think.

  

When you first come about the scripture, you'ld memorize the scripture, then think on it.

  

Acts 6:2-5

  

3 John 2... The word prospers in this passage means there is an impact in the way you relate to things

  

Nobody who is full of the word hates knowledge. The word enhances your mental capacity, it enhances the way you deal with things.

  

Luke 14:

There is a fact of life that brings about discipleship

  

Only a fool says people are a cause of his misfortune. A selfish man never takes responsibility

  

In the passage above, Jesus talks about how that only fools quit.

  

You have to plan not to fail... That you have a position means you have to read more. To succeed, you have to plan. Success is when preparations means opportunity.

  

Jesus said to sit down and plan... Things would happen and you'ld have to think twice about what you've just done.

  

Also, timing... Never to be in a hurry. The deeper your foundation, the stronger the house built. He gives you the time to think - Jesus.

  

First place the word impacts is the mode of speaking... The word of God affects how you speak. It doesn't mean you have to respond with scriptures in all things. All Jesus said became scriptures, he didn't quote scriptures always.

  

James 3:1-6, 1:19

Slow to speak doesn't mean stammering or being sluggish about speaking it simply means slow to speak, knowing when to talk and when not to talk. That's what many of us need to learn to do.

  

God was slow to speak, he spoke gradually what he was going to do... Heb 1:1-3... Talking about sundry times and divers manners

  

He used mysteries... To hid great things to kill people but to do it for good. Mark 4:11, Amos 3:7, 1Pet1:10-12

  

God speaks the things he wants to do gradually. He had to measure the amount of knowledge he gives out because he knows [[SATAN|Satan]] knowing could also affect what he had to do. 1 Cor 2. He said things that could be understood gradually. Jesus had many things to say unto us, but we could not bear them that moment. There are certain times we cannot say certain things. There is no holiness in talkativeness. The level of the audience determines what is spoken. 1 Cor 3:1-3, after the Spirit of truth had come, Paul still had to measure what he said.

  

Jesus' death was spoken in parables. He spoke gradually. He kept the important facts for the deed to be done. In Matt 16:23, Peter attempted to talk but Jesus rebuked him.

  

KNOWLEDGE IS POWER.

  

Most times, we don't know how much power we give people with the knowledge we give them. It doesn't mean you should keep secrets.

  

Notice how that audiences were chosen. Jesus chose his audience, God chose his audience. You must really know your audience. Even in the tongues, the speaker speaks and they don't understand, it's because people are tested spiritually before information is disclosed between them and God.

  

Abraham -  father

Sarah - mother

  

Imagine after God told Abraham to sacrifice Isaac, he didn't tell Sarah. She was a faith woman, but she couldn't handle on. He tells nobody.

  

John 8:44, 1 Cor 2, Eph... Satan walks in the heart of men

  

1Tim 5:15... Some people can be born again and not be the right audience still for they have ears with the devil.

  

Always ask intelligent questions...

  

Remember David and Saul, 1 Sam 16, and Samuel... Samuel asked what would happen to him if Saul sees him. He avoided the death of himself and the death of David by telling Saul nothing

  

You need to be led by the Spirit of God to know how to disclose information. You need to pray about who to talk to. Not everybody needs to hear all the stuffs you need and want to say.

  

KNOW WHAT TO SAY AND WHO TO SAY IT TO.

  

Matt 2... The story of the wise men and Herod. They were warned by God.

  

Wisdom begins with our words. Silence shows wisdom.

  

Everybody is given information according to their roles, the kind of knowledge they have.

  

Know the kind of information you give out.

  

One of the abilities of a pastor is to know what to speak and when to speak it.

  

After you give one a shekel, don't test him with five.  Do not keep investing in someone who isn't faithful, it doesn't make him the more faithful.

  

Information, words are the most powerful things on earth, when you merge it with the word of God, it produces wisdom.

  

James 1:9

  

Add this to your prayer life, your ministry.

  

Only a fool speaks before he thinks.
