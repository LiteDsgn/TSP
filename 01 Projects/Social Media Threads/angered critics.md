One evidence that the message of ultimate reconciliation is true is when we hear that God’s love will not fail for a single person who ever lived …and we feel _anger_. We react much like Jonah, or The Elder Brother, the Vineyard workers, or the Pharisees. This angry reaction is indicative that we are not wanting everyone to come to repentance but rather willing that _many_ will perish. God, we are told, desires that all people be saved.

Do you desire all be saved? Or does the thought of God’s mercy extending farther than you thought make you _angry_? This specific kind of anger is an indicator that the message you are railing against just might be the same message rejected by Jonah, the elder brother, the vineyard workers, and the religious leaders. What if the good news of the Gospel is that the love of the Savior of the World never fails and that His mercies never come to an end…for anyone? Does that make you angry? Do you, like your Father, at least _desire_ for all to be saved?
