# Title Unearthing the Divine Gift A Look at Ephesians 28

**Title: Unearthing the Divine Gift: A Look at Ephesians 2:8**

  

**Subheading: Unpacking the Faith of God and the Unmerited Grace in Christ**

  

**Main Verse: "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God." ~ Ephesians 2:8 KJV**

  

**Introduction:**

  

Embarking on the journey of Ephesians 2:8, we step into the realm of divine love, where salvation is not earned, but gracefully gifted. This is a journey not walked by our feet, but by our hearts, opened by the faith of God, which reveals the completed work of salvation.

  

  

**First Point: The Role of Grace**

  

Salvation is a gift borne of divine grace, a grace that envelops all who are in Christ. Consider the sun that illuminates the earth without the earth asking for it, so is God's grace, shining upon all in Christ, illuminating the path of salvation. It's not an achievement, nor a reward; it is an act of love, of God reaching out, much like a parent holding out a hand to a child.

  

  

**Second Point: Through Faith**

  

However, this salvation is brought into realization through faith - not a faith that we muster, but the unwavering faith of God. Just as a composer knows the symphony hidden within the silence before the first note is played, so too God's faith foresaw our salvation. It is God's faith that recognized our co-inclusion in Christ's resurrection, as depicted in Colossians 2:12, and called it into being. This faith, resolute and unchanging, reveals to us the gift of salvation that has been prepared since before the dawn of time.

  

  

**Third Point: A Gift, Not of Ourselves**

  

This gift of salvation isn't of ourselves, it's not something we conjure or craft. Much like a bird doesn't create the air in which it soars, we do not create this salvation. It's a pre-existing, divine gift, a testament of God's enduring love and belief in our place beside Him.

  

  

**Conclusion:**

Ephesians 2:8 calls us to view our salvation not as a goal to be achieved, but as a gift to be received. It is an invitation to partake in a divine narrative that started before time itself, a narrative of God's faith and love towards mankind. It is a reminder that we are forever held within the embrace of God's grace, through His faith, in the grand tapestry of His divine plan. And so, our salvation is not an uncertain endeavor but a sure promise, a completed work - one that invites us to rest in the certainty of God's unfailing love.
