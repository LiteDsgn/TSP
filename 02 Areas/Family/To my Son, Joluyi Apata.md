# To my Son, Joluyi Apata

Theme: The Restoration of Weight and Glory.

---

### I. The Architecture of Your Name

My Son, a name in our culture is not merely a label; it is a prophecy. In Yoruba, we say “Orukọ ni ro ni,” meaning "the name affects behavior." But deeper than behavior, the name defines Ontology—the very nature of your being.

  

Your name, Jọlúyì, is a command, a prayer, and a description of your reality in Christ. It is constructed from three ancient Yoruba roots:

  

1. Jọ (To Resemble / To Mirror): This implies that you are not the Source, but the Image. In Hebrew, this is Tzelem (Image). You are a mirror.
    
2. Olu (The Lord / The Head): This points to the Source, the Adonai, the Head of all things.
    
3. Iyi (Honor / Glory / Value): This is the destination of the name. It describes what aspect of the Lord you are mirroring.
    

Jọlúyì: "He who Resembles the Lord of Honor."

  

But to understand this, you must understand the theology of the APATA (The Rock) upon which you stand. We are the Apata family. In Scripture, God is Tzur (The Rock). A rock is immovable, ancient, and substantial. You are the Glory (Iyi) that rests upon the Rock (Apata).

### II. The Yoruba Depth: What is Iyi?

In the world of the Yoruba, Iyi is one of the highest virtues. It translates as Honor, Prestige, and Value. But philosophically, Iyi is the social and spiritual weight a man carries.

  

There is a saying: “Iyi l'agba” (Honor is the sign of eldership/maturity).However, Iyi is not just fame. Fame is noise; Iyi is silence. Fame floats; Iyi sits.

  

- A man with money but no character has no Iyi.
    
- A man with power but no wisdom has no Iyi.
    

Your name implies that your Value does not come from what you buy, but from Whom you resemble. You possess Iyi because you resemble the Olu (The Lord). Your worth is derivative, and because it comes from an Eternal Source, your Value is eternal.

### III. The Theological Depth: Iyi as [[KAVOD|Kavod]]

My son, here is the mystery of your name in the language of redemption. The Yoruba word Iyi is the mirror of the Hebrew word Kavod.

  

KAVOD (Glory) literally means "Heavy" or "Weighty." God’s Glory is not just a bright light; it is His heaviness, His substance, His undeniable reality.

  

The History of Your Name in Scripture:

  

1. Creation (The [[YESH|Yesh]]): When God created man, He crowned him with Kavod (Psalm 8:5). [[ADAM|Adam]] had "Weight." He mattered. He had Yesh (Substance).
    
2. The Fall (The [[QAL|Qal]]): When man sinned ([[CHATA|Chata]]), he didn't just break a rule; he lost his Weight. We became Qal (Light/Empty). We became like chaff that the wind blows away (Psalm 1:4). We became [[HAVEL|Havel]] (Vapor). This is the tragedy of the human race: we are light, empty, and fleeting.
    
3. The Redemption (The Great Exchange): This is the Monergistic work of God. Jesus Christ, who possessed infinite Kavod, came to earth. On the Cross, He was [[TALAH|Talah]] (Hung/Lifted Up). By hanging on the tree, He took the position of Qal—He was treated as weightless, cursed, and rejected.
    

- Why? So that He could give you His Kavod.
    

Jọlúyì, your name is the Gospel. You are named Joluyi because you are the proof that the "Weight" has returned. You are not Qal (light/empty). You are not Havel (vapor). You possess the Iyi of God.

  

When you walk into a room, you bring the "Heaviness" of God’s presence. You are not to be taken lightly because the Spirit of the Living God rests upon you. You have Substance.

### IV. Your Function: The Reflection of Substance

You must understand the relationship between Iyi (Honor) and Ìwà (Character/Existence).

  

- Ìwà is your Yesh (Your inner substance).
    
- Iyi is your Kavod (Your outer manifestation).
    

You cannot have true Iyi without Ìwà. If you try to manufacture honor without inner substance, it is fake—it is Havel (Vanity).

  

Your name is a call to [[HOMOLOGEO|Homologeo]] (Confession/Agreement).Every day, you must "Agree" with God about who you are. The world will try to tell you that you are ordinary, that you are merely dust. You must stand on the Apata (Rock) and declare:"I am Jọlúyì. I resemble the Lord of Glory. I carry the Weight of the Kingdom. I am not empty vapor; I am filled with the fullness of God."

  

### V. A Father's Charge

Jọlúyì Apata, You are the Honor of the Rock. Do not chase the applause of men; that is light wind. Seek only the Kavod of God.When you speak, speak with weight.When you promise, let your word be solid (Yesh).You are the visible evidence ([[PHANEROO|Phaneroo]]) that God has not left humanity empty. Walk in your Iyi.
