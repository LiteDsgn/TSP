# PURPOSE, PRESSURE & PROGRESS (1)

## A 30-Minute Talk for CAC Graceville Lagos Online Fest

**Theme:** Trusting God Through Expectations, Career Pressure, Relationships & Personal Growth

---

## INTRODUCTION (2 minutes)

Good evening, everyone. My name is Henry, and I'm honored to be here with you tonight.

Let me start with a question: **How many of you have ever felt like you're buried?**

- Buried under expectations from family
    
- Buried under career pressure—"When will you get that job?"
    
- Buried under relationship pressures—"When are you getting married?"
    
- Buried under the weight of your own dreams that seem to be taking too long
    

If you've ever felt this way, I want you to know tonight: **You're not stuck. You're planted.**

And there's a massive difference between the two.

Tonight, we're going to talk about **Purpose, Pressure, and Progress** from a perspective you may not have heard before. We're going to discover that the pressure you're experiencing is not God punishing you—it's God **preparing** you.

Let's pray.

## PART ONE: THE SEED IN THE SOIL (7 minutes)

### The Story We've Been Told vs. The Story That's Actually Happening

Open your Bibles to **John 12:24**. Jesus says something that will change how you see your current season:

> _"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."_

Now, let me ask you: When a seed falls into the soil, what happens?

- It gets covered in darkness
    
- It experiences pressure from every side
    
- It looks like it's dying
    
- From the outside, it looks like it's been buried
    

But here's what we miss: **The seed is not being buried. The seed is being planted.**

### Your Life Right Now

Many of you are in university, or you just graduated. Some of you are in that space where:

- You've sent 50 CVs and nobody is replying
    
- Your mates are getting engaged and you're still waiting
    
- You have dreams but no clear path
    
- You have vision but it feels like you're stuck in the dark
    

And well-meaning people (including Christians) keep telling you, _"Just pray harder. Just have faith. Just wait on God."_

But nobody explains **why** the waiting feels so heavy.

**Here's the truth:** You're not stuck. You're germinating.

### The Purpose of Pressure

Look at **Romans 8:28-30**:

> _"And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son."_

Notice the phrase: **"Conformed to the image of His Son."**

God is not trying to make you comfortable. God is trying to make you into **the image of Christ**.

And how did Christ become Christ? Through pressure:

- Born in a manger (pressure)
    
- Tempted in the wilderness (pressure)
    
- Misunderstood by His family (pressure)
    
- Betrayed by His friends (pressure)
    
- Crucified on a cross (ultimate pressure)
    

But after all that pressure? **Resurrection. Glory. Fruit.**

The pressure you're experiencing is not random. The pressure is **breaking the shell** so the life inside you can emerge.

**Illustration:** When you plant a seed, what keeps it in the soil? The weight of the earth pressing down. If you remove that pressure too early, the seed never germinates. The darkness and the pressure are **necessary** for the transformation.

---

## PART TWO: GOD'S QUESTION IN YOUR PRESSURE (8 minutes)

### Where Are You?

Turn with me to **Genesis 3:9**. After [[ADAM|Adam]] sinned and hid himself, God asked him a question:

> _"Where are you?"_

Now, this is interesting. God is omnipresent—He knows everything. So why is He asking, "Where are you?"

Because the question is not geographical. **The question is ontological.** God is asking:

_"What state of being do you think you're in? Do you realize where you actually are? Do you understand what's happening to you?"_

### The Real Question God Is Asking You Today

When you're under pressure—when the job isn't coming, when the relationship isn't working out, when your peers seem to be progressing and you feel left behind—God is asking you the same question:

**"Where are you? What do you think is happening to you?"**

Your answer determines everything.

**Wrong Answer:** "I'm stuck. I'm failing. I'm behind. God has forgotten me."

**Right Answer:** "I'm planted. I'm being prepared. I'm in the soil, and God is working on me in the dark where nobody can see."

### The Nigerian Context: "When Will You...?"

Let's be honest. In Nigeria, the pressure is real:

- "When will you finish school?"
    
- "When will you get a job?"
    
- "When will you marry?"
    
- "When will you build a house?"
    
- "When will you have children?"
    

And when you're in your 20s or early 30s and you haven't checked these boxes yet, people look at you like something is wrong.

But here's what I want you to understand: **God's timing is not Nigerian timing.**

God doesn't operate on our cultural calendar. God operates on the principle of **maturity**, not speed.

Look at **Galatians 4:1-2**:

> _"I mean that the heir, as long as he is a child, is no different from a slave, though he is the owner of everything, but he is under guardians and managers until the date set by his father."_

You are an heir. You already own everything in Christ. But there's a **date set by the Father** for when you receive it in fullness.

Your job is not to rush the date. Your job is to **trust the Father** while you're being prepared.

---

## PART THREE: WHAT GOD IS BUILDING (8 minutes)

### You Are Not a Project. You Are a Temple.

**1 Corinthians 3:16** says:

> _"Do you not know that you are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in you?"_

God is not trying to fix you. God is trying to **build** you.

When you're under pressure in your career, in your relationships, in your personal growth—God is not punishing you. God is **constructing something**.

### Three Things God Is Building In You

#### 1. **Structural Integrity ([[TAMIM|Tamim]])**

This is a Hebrew word that means "complete," "whole," "integrated."

When God says, "Be perfect" (Matthew 5:48), He doesn't mean "never make a mistake." He means "be whole—let your inside match your outside."

The pressure you're facing is revealing where you're fractured:

- Where you say one thing but do another
    
- Where you present one image on social media but live another reality privately
    
- Where you claim to trust God but you're anxious all the time
    

God is using this season to make you **whole**—so that the person you are in public is the same person you are in private.

**Practical example:** When you keep getting rejected from jobs, God may be asking, "Are you seeking your identity in your career, or in Me?" The pressure reveals the crack, so God can seal it.

#### 2. **Capacity to Carry Glory ([[KADOSH|Kadosh]])**

This Hebrew word means "holy," but it literally means "set apart" or "insulated."

Think about it like this: If you want to carry high voltage electricity, you need proper wiring. If the wiring is weak, the power will destroy the system.

God is preparing you to carry **glory**. But before He gives you the platform, the influence, the money, the marriage, the success—He has to make sure you can handle it without it destroying you.

**Nigerian illustration:** How many people do we know who "blew" (got money, got fame) and then crashed? Why? Because they got the blessing before they had the capacity to carry it.

The pressure you're in right now is God **upgrading your wiring** so that when the blessing comes, it won't destroy you.

**James 1:2-4** says:

> _"Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing."_

#### 3. **Rest in the Process ([[MENUHA|Menuha]])**

This is the Hebrew word for "rest."

But it doesn't mean "doing nothing." It means **"non-striving."**

It means trusting that God is the one working, not you.

**Matthew 11:28-30**:

> _"Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."_

When you're striving—sending CVs obsessively, refreshing your phone for responses, comparing yourself to others on Instagram—you're operating in **anxiety**, not rest.

But when you trust that God is the Architect, that He's building you, that the pressure is **purposeful**—you enter rest.

And **rest is attractive**. People are drawn to people who have peace in the storm.

### The Blueprint Is Christ

Here's the key: God is not building you randomly. God is building you into **the image of Christ**.

**Ephesians 1:4** says:

> _"He chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him."_

Before you were born, before Nigeria existed, before time began—God chose you **in Christ**.

That means:

- Everything Christ has, you have
    
- Everything Christ is, you are becoming
    
- The pressure Christ went through, you're going through—but you're not alone
    

**Romans 8:17**:

> _"And if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him."_

You're not suffering because you're cursed. You're suffering **with Christ** so you can be **glorified with Christ**.

## PART FOUR: PRACTICAL STEPS — TRUSTING GOD IN THE PRESSURE (4 minutes)

### 1. Change Your Perspective

Stop saying, "I'm stuck." Start saying, "I'm planted."

Stop saying, "God has forgotten me." Start saying, "God is working on me in the dark."

**Psalm 139:15-16**:

> _"My frame was not hidden from you, when I was being made in secret, intricately woven in the depths of the earth. Your eyes saw my unformed substance; in your book were written, every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there was none of them."_

God sees you even when you feel invisible. The "secret place" is where God does His best work.

### 2. Let the Pressure Teach You

Instead of resisting the pressure, ask:

- "God, what are You trying to build in me?"
    
- "What weakness is this revealing?"
    
- "What character are You forming?"
    

**2 Corinthians 12:9-10**:

> _"But he said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.' Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me. For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities. For when I am weak, then I am strong."_

The pressure is making you **strong**.

### 3. Stop Comparing Your Chapter to Someone Else's Chapter

Everyone's seed germinates at a different rate.

Some seeds take 7 days. Some take 40 days. Some take years.

But **every seed that is planted in good soil will eventually grow**.

Your timeline is not your friend's timeline. And that's okay.

**Ecclesiastes 3:1**:

> _"For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven."_

### 4. Trust the Finished Work

Here's the mystery: **In God's eyes, you're already complete.**

**Colossians 2:10**:

> _"And you have been filled in him, who is the head of all rule and authority."_

You're not trying to **become** complete. You're waking up to the fact that **in Christ, you already are complete**.

The pressure is just revealing what was always true.

## CONCLUSION (1 minute)

Let me bring this home.

You are not a mistake. You are not behind. You are not forgotten.

**You are a seed in the soil.**

And every bit of pressure you're experiencing—the career struggles, the relationship questions, the expectations from family, the disappointments—**all of it is working together** to crack the shell so the life inside you can emerge.

God is not trying to make you comfortable. God is trying to make you into **the image of His Son**.

And when the shell finally breaks, when you emerge from the soil, when the world sees what God has been building in secret—

**They won't see you. They'll see Christ in you.**

**Colossians 1:27**:

> _"To them God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory."_

So tonight, I want you to make a decision:

**Will you trust the Architect?** **Will you rest in the process?** **Will you believe that the pressure is purposeful?**

If your answer is yes, then say this with me:

_"I am not stuck. I am planted. I am not buried. I am growing. The pressure I feel is not punishment—it is preparation. God is building me into a temple that can carry His glory. And I trust Him."_

Let's pray.

## CLOSING PRAYER

Father, we thank You for every person here tonight. We thank You that You see them even when they feel invisible. We thank You that You're working even when they can't see progress.

Lord, for those under pressure—pressure from expectations, pressure from career struggles, pressure from relationships, pressure from their own dreams—we ask that You help them see: they are not stuck, they are **planted**.

Teach us to trust You in the dark. Teach us to rest while You work. Teach us to believe that the shell must break before the life can emerge.

We surrender our timelines to You. We surrender our anxiety to You. We choose to trust that You are the Architect, and You're building something beautiful in us.

In Jesus' name, Amen.

## POST-TALK Q&A PREPARATION (If time permits)

**Possible Questions & Responses:**

**Q: "But how do I know if I'm planted or if I'm just being disobedient to God?"**

**A:** Great question. The difference is this: If you're planted, you'll have **peace** even in the pressure. If you're being disobedient, you'll have **conviction** (the Holy Spirit telling you to change direction).

Also, being planted doesn't mean you're passive—you still apply for jobs, you still work on yourself, you still pursue relationships. But you do it from **rest**, not from **striving**.

**Proverbs 3:5-6**: _"Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths."_

---

**Q: "What if I feel like I've been waiting too long? How much longer?"**

**A:** I understand. Waiting is hard, especially in Nigerian culture where there's so much pressure to "arrive."

But here's what I've learned: God is less concerned with **speed** and more concerned with **maturity**.

**Galatians 6:9**: _"And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up."_

Notice: "in due season"—not "in your preferred season."

Keep trusting. Keep growing. The seed is germinating even when you can't see it.

---

**Q: "How do I deal with family pressure and cultural expectations?"**

**A:** This is real. Nigerian parents can be... intense. 😅

But here's the balance: **Honor your parents, but don't let them become your God.**

You can respect their input without making their expectations your identity.

**Matthew 6:33**: _"But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you."_

When God is your source of approval, you can receive advice from family without being crushed by their disappointment.

Also, sometimes the best testimony is **becoming the answer** they're praying for, even if it doesn't look like what they expected.

---

**FINAL ENCOURAGEMENT:**

You are not alone in this season. Every great person in the Bible went through a "seed in the soil" season:

- **Joseph** was in a pit, then in prison, before he became Prime Minister.
    
- **Moses** was in the wilderness for 40 years before he led Israel.
    
- **David** was anointed king but then ran from Saul for years before he actually sat on the throne.
    
- **Jesus Himself** was hidden for 30 years before His 3-year ministry.
    

The time in the soil is not wasted. It's **essential**.

So keep growing. Keep trusting. Keep resting in the One who is building you.

The breakthrough is coming. But more importantly, **you are being transformed**.

God bless you all. Thank you.
