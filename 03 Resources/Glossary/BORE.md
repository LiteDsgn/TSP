# BORE (בּוֹרֵא)

#### Standard Meaning:

The active participle of BARA—"Creator," "the One who creates." Typically understood as the divine Manufacturer.

#### Hebraic Meaning:

The ACTIVE AGENT, the BINDING FORCE, the Energy that **connects** the Source to manifestation. Note the critical addition: the letter **VAV (ו)** is inserted in the middle of the root B-R-A to form BO-RE.

#### Paleo-Hebrew Linguistics:


- **Bet (ב):** House—Container
    
- **Vav (ו):** Nail, Hook—Connector, Bridge
    
- **Resh (ר):** Head—Authority, First
    
- **Aleph (א):** Source—God, Strength
    

#### The Picture:

"The CONNECTOR (Vav) linking the SOURCE (Aleph) to the HOUSE (Bet) through the HEAD (Resh)"**

**The Vav is the key.** It's the **HOOK**, the **NAIL**, the **BRIDGE** between Infinite Potential and Finite Manifestation.

#### My Insight:

The Creator (BORE) is not a distant manufacturer who made things and walked away. The Creator is **the Potential Energy actively maintaining the connection**.

**He IS the Vav (Nail) that holds atoms together.**

This is **COLOSSIANS 1:17** encoded in Hebrew: "By him all things consist (hold together)"—He is the tension that keeps the universe spinning. Without the Monoergetic flow of the Creator, reality **dissolves**.

**The distinction:**

- **BORE (Creator)** = The Energy as **POTENTIAL**, the Active Agent, the Knower
    
- **BRIA (Creation)** = The Energy as **KINETIC**, the Result, the Known
    

But they are **ONE SUBSTANCE** at different modulations.

**The Supra-Logic:**

- The Creator **IS** the writer
    
- But He is also **the ink and the paper**
    
- He is **Subject AND Object**
    

This is pure Yesh-Echad: **"Nature" is simply God slowing down His vibration to become visible.**

**The Creator is the Force.** Creation is the Force made **tangible**.

#### Scripture(s):


- Isaiah 40:28 — "Have you not known? Have you not heard? The LORD is the everlasting God, the Creator [BORE] of the ends of the earth"
    
- Ecclesiastes 12:1 — "Remember also your Creator [BORE] in the days of your youth"
    
- Isaiah 43:15 — "I am the LORD, your Holy One, the Creator [BORE] of Israel, your King"
    

#### Narrative Context:

Used to emphasize God's ongoing authority over creation. Not past-tense manufacturing but **present-tense sustaining**. The One who maintains the Vav (connection) between Source and manifestation.
