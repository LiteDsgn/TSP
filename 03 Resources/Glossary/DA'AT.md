# DA'AT

#### Standard Meaning:

"Knowledge." Often confused with intellectual information or data accumulation.

#### Hebraic Meaning:

_Da'at_ is **Experiential Union**. It is the "Knowledge" of connection. "Adam _knew_ (_Yada_) Eve his wife" (Gen 4:1). This was not a transfer of data; it was a biological and spiritual merger. In the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, _Da'at_ is the invisible sephirah—the interface where Wisdom (_Chokhmah_) and Understanding (_Binah_) merge to become Reality. In the **Yesh-Echad** framework, _Da'at_ is the realization of Non-Duality. It is the state where the Knower and the Known become One.

#### Paleo-Hebrew Linguistics:


- **Dalet (ד):** Door—Pathway, Entrance.
    
- **Ayin (ע):** Eye—To See, Experience, Watch.
    
- **Tav (ת):** Cross—Mark, Covenant, Sign.
    

#### The Picture:

The **DOOR (Dalet)** of **SEEING (Ayin)** the **COVENANT MARK (Tav)**.Or: **SEEING (Ayin)** the **DOOR (Dalet)** to the **CROSS (Tav)**._Note:_ True Knowledge is inextricably linked to the Covenant/Cross. It is "Seeing the End from the Beginning."

#### My Insight:

_Da'at_ is the **Operating System of the New Man**.The Fall was a crash from _Da'at_ (Union) to Data (Binary Knowledge of Good/Evil).

- **Torah as Rules:** This is Data. It is external. "I know _about_ God."
    
- **Torah as Identity:** This is _Da'at_. It is internal. "I know God by _being_ His habitation."When God speaks, He speaks to awaken _Da'at_. He wants us to move from "Theology" (Study of God) to "Theophany" (Manifestation of God).The "List of Do's and Don'ts" is what happens when _Da'at_ is lost. When you lose the intuition of Love (Union), you need a manual on how to act like a lover._Shuv_ (Repentance) is the return to _Da'at_. It is the "Ah-ha!" moment where the Seed remembers it is the Tree. It is the collapse of the wave function—where the Infinite Probability of God becomes the Finite Reality of the Believer.Translucency is pure _Da'at_—where the mind of Christ fully displaces the mind of the Ego.
    

#### Scripture(s):


- **Genesis 4:1** — "And Adam knew [Yada/Da'at] Eve his wife." (Knowledge as Union).
    
- **Hosea 4:6** — "My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge [Da'at]." (Lack of Union/Identity, not lack of Bible study).
    
- **Habakkuk 2:14** — "For the earth will be filled with the knowledge [Da'at] of the glory of the LORD." (The universal realization of Union).
    
- **Proverbs 3:6** — "In all your ways acknowledge [Yada] Him." (Merge with Him in every action).
    

#### Narrative Context:

The Tree of Knowledge (The divorce of knowledge from Life). The intimate knowing of Moses ("Face to face"). The New Covenant promise ("They shall all know Me").
