# DEMUT

#### Standard Meaning:

"Likeness," "Similarity," "Resemblance." Used in Genesis 1:26 alongside _Tselem_.

#### Hebraic Meaning:

_Demut_ is **BLOOD-LIKENESS** or **COVENANT RESEMBLANCE**. While _Tselem_ emphasizes the shadow/projection aspect of the image, _Demut_ emphasizes the **FAMILIAL CONNECTION**, the shared substance. The first two letters (_Dalet-Mem_) form **DAM** (blood), suggesting that this "likeness" is not superficial but **GENETIC**. We are not "like" God in the way a painting resembles a subject; we are "like" God in the way a child resembles a parent—through shared life-essence.

#### Paleo-Hebrew Linguistics:


- **Dalet (ד):** Door — Pathway, Entrance
    
- **Mem (מ):** Water — Chaos, Blood, Life-fluid
    
- **Vav (ו):** Hook — Connector, Nail
    
- **Tav (ת):** Cross — Mark, Covenant, Sign
    

#### The Picture:

The DOOR (_Dalet_) to the BLOOD (_Mem_) HOOKED (_Vav_) to the COVENANT MARK (_Tav_)._Or: The PATHWAY through LIFE-FLUID secured to the SIGN._

#### My Insight:

_Tselem_ is the **FORM** (Shadow); _Demut_ is the **SUBSTANCE** (Blood). This validates the theology that humanity is "God (_Aleph_) in Blood (_Dam_)." When Christ took on flesh, He was not adopting something foreign; He was entering the _Demut_ that humanity already possessed. The Incarnation revealed what was always true: the "likeness" is not metaphorical but **ONTOLOGICAL**. We are OF His substance. This is why 2 Peter 1:4 says we "become partakers of the divine nature"—the _Demut_ was always there, waiting to be manifested.

#### Scripture(s):


- **Genesis 1:26:** "Let us make man in our image [_Tselem_], after our likeness [_Demut_]."
    
- **Genesis 5:3:** "Adam... fathered a son in his own likeness [_Demut_]." (Blood transmission).
    
- **2 Peter 1:4:** "Partakers of the divine nature."
    

#### Narrative Context:

The theological foundation for the Incarnation and the prohibition against murder (Gen 9:6).
