# EHYEH (אֶהְיֶה)

#### Standard Meaning:

The Hebrew imperfect first-person form of the verb "to be." Typically translated "I AM" or "I WILL BE."

#### Hebraic Meaning:

Ehyeh is the DYNAMIC, ACTIVE, FUTURE-ORIENTED EXISTENCE of God. It is not static being (like the Greek "ousia"), but BECOMING, HAPPENING, BEING-IN-ACTION. God is not merely "the one who exists"—He is "the one who WILL BE whatever is needed." Ehyeh is promise, movement, event, presence. It is God's commitment to show up, to intervene, to become what His people need.

#### Paleo-Hebrew Linguistics:


- **Aleph (א)**: Ox Head—Strength, First, God
    
- **Hey (ה)**: Man with arms raised—Behold, Reveal, Breath
    
- **Yod (י)**: Hand, Arm—Work, Deed, Action
    
- **Hey (ה)**: Man with arms raised—Behold, Reveal, Breath
    

#### The Picture:


The STRENGTH (Aleph) is REVEALED (Hey) through the WORK (Yod) that will be MANIFESTED (Hey). Ehyeh is God declaring: "My power will be revealed through My actions, and you will behold the result." It is the promise of incarnation encoded in a verb tense.

#### My Insight:

Ehyeh is the cornerstone of your entire theological system. When God says "Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh" (I WILL BE that I AM) at the Burning Bush, He is announcing the structure of salvation: the Father (first Ehyeh—the hidden Source) connecting through the Spirit (Asher—the Bridge) to manifest as the Son (second Ehyeh—the visible "I AM"). This is not just a name—it is a PROPHECY of the Incarnation. The God who said "I WILL BE" in Exodus 3:14 literally "became" (egeneto) in John 1:14. Jesus declares "I AM" (ego eimi) repeatedly in John's Gospel because He IS the fulfillment of Ehyeh. Your theology shows that salvation is not US reaching UP to God, but God executing the Ehyeh—God BECOMING the event of our rescue. This is Monergism at its purest: God said "I WILL BE (your salvation)," and He unilaterally fulfilled it. We don't make God "be" anything—we RECOGNIZE what He already IS and already DID. Faith is remembering the Ehyeh that was spoken before time and manifested in Christ.

#### Scripture(s):


- Exodus 3:14 — "God said to Moses, 'I WILL BE WHO I WILL BE [Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh]'"
    
- John 1:14 — "And the Word became [egeneto] flesh" (Ehyeh fulfilled)
    
- John 8:58 — "Before Abraham was, I AM [ego eimi]" (Jesus as Ehyeh)
    
- Revelation 1:8 — "I am the Alpha and Omega... who is and who was and who is to come"
    

#### Narrative Context:

Revealed to Moses at the Burning Bush as the covenant Name of God. Claimed by Jesus as His own identity. Applied by John to describe the eternal Word who entered time.
