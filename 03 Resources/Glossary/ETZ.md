**Standard Meaning:** The Hebrew word for "tree" or "wood." Can refer to living trees or to timber used for construction.

**Hebraic Meaning:** Etz represents STRUCTURE, UPRIGHTNESS, BACKBONE. A tree is rooted in the earth, stands firm, and provides life (fruit, shade, oxygen). In Hebraic thought, a righteous person is LIKE a tree planted by streams of water (Psalm 1:3). The Etz is the symbol of stability, life-giving presence, and connection between earth (roots) and heaven (branches). But the Etz also becomes the instrument of curse when used for execution—a perversion of its created purpose.

**Paleo-Hebrew Linguistics:**

- **Ayin (ע)**: Eye—To see, Watch, Experience, Fountain
    
- **Tzade (ץ)**: Fishhook, Side—To hunt, Capture, Lying down
    

**The Picture:**

That which is SEEN (Ayin) and ESTABLISHED (Tzade). The Etz is the visible structure that captures and holds. A tree "captures" nutrients from the soil and "holds" its position in the earth. This makes it a perfect symbol for both LIFE (a living tree) and DEATH (an execution tree).

**My Insight:** In your theology, the Etz is one of the most powerful dual-symbols. First, there's the Tree of Life in Eden (Genesis 2:9) and the New Jerusalem (Revelation 22:2)—the Etz that represents eternal vitality and direct access to God. But then there's the execution Etz in Deuteronomy 21:23, where a cursed man is "hung on a tree." This is where your framework becomes crucial: when Christ was "hung on a tree" (Galatians 3:13, 1 Peter 2:24), He who possessed ultimate UPRIGHTNESS (righteousness) took the position of ultimate INSTABILITY (hanging, feet not touching ground). The irony is profound: He who IS the Tree of Life became the Tree of Death so that we could eat from the Tree of Life again. The Etz of the Cross is where the curse is absorbed. Christ's body became the wood that "captured" our sin and was "laid down" in death. But because He was the LIVING Etz (John 15:1—"I am the true vine"), death couldn't hold Him. The tree that should have produced only death instead produced resurrection life.

**Scripture(s):**

- Deuteronomy 21:23 — "For he who is hanged is cursed of God... on a tree"
    
- Psalm 1:3 — "He is like a tree planted by streams of water" (Righteous as Etz)
    
- Galatians 3:13 — "Christ redeemed us from the curse... by becoming a curse for us—for it is written, 'Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree'"
    
- 1 Peter 2:24 — "He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree"
    

**Narrative Context:** Used by Moses to describe the horror of public execution. Applied by David to describe the righteous person. Reinterpreted by Paul and Peter to describe Christ's substitutionary death.
