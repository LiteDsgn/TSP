# GIHON


#### Standard Meaning:

The name of the second river flowing out of [[EDEN|Eden]] (Genesis 2:13). Etymology possibly from a root meaning "to burst forth," "to gush out," or "to break through with force."

#### Hebraic Meaning:

GIHON is THE FREQUENCY OF DEPTH AND BURSTING FORTH, the vertical, intensive flow of divine life that penetrates to the depths and erupts from the hidden places. It represents [[RACHAMIM]] (womb-love), the groaning of travail, the water breaking in childbirth, the spring bursting from rock. Unlike [[PISHON]] (which spreads horizontally/extensively), GIHON goes DEEP (vertically/intensively). It is the Spirit's work in the hidden chambers, the sanctuary, the subconscious depths. GIHON is intercession, contemplation, the "deep calling unto deep," the bursting forth of life from what appeared dead. It circles [[CUSH]] (the land of heat/darkness/depth), representing the work that happens in the dark, hot, pressured places where seeds germinate.

#### Paleo-Hebrew Linguistics:

- **Gimel (ג):** Camel—To lift, carry, transport
- **Yod (י):** Hand—Work, deed
- **Chet (ח):** Fence, Wall—Separation, sanctuary, chamber
- **Vav (ו):** Nail, Hook—Connect
- **Nun (ן):** Seed—Life, heir (final form)

#### The Picture:

The LIFTING/CARRYING (Gimel) WORK (Yod) that brings to the SANCTUARY (Chet) through CONNECTION (Vav) producing LIFE (Nun). Or: The transporting action that brings into the sacred chamber through connection to generate the heir. GIHON is the flow that lifts (Gimel), works (Yod), accesses the inner room (Chet), maintains connection (Vav), and produces life (Nun).

#### My Insight:

GIHON is the second frequency of the One River, operating simultaneously with [[PISHON]], [[HIDDEKEL]], and EUPHRATES. While [[PISHON]] spreads wide across the surface ([[HAVILAH|Havilah]]/vapor-land), GIHON penetrates deep into the darkness ([[CUSH|Cush]]/heat-land). Genesis 2:13 says GIHON "flows around the whole land of [[CUSH|Cush]]." [[CUSH|Cush]] (כּוּשׁ) is associated with blackness, heat, depth—the hidden, pressured, uncomfortable places. This is where GIHON operates. If [[PISHON]] is evangelism/outreach, GIHON is intercession/depth. If [[PISHON]] is the arterial blood flowing out to extremities, GIHON is the venous blood returning from the depths to be re-oxygenated at the heart. GIHON represents the "bursting forth" that happens AFTER deep burial—the resurrection life that erupts from the tomb, the spring that gushes from the rock (Exodus 17:6), the water breaking in childbirth. This is the frequency of Romans 8:26—"the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words." It's the frequency of [[TARDEMAH|Tardemah]] (deep sleep) where God does His deepest work. When blocked: hypoxia (oxygen starvation), mechanical religion without presence, activity without life. When flowing: encounter, passion, travail, breakthrough, resurrection power erupting from what appeared dead. Every believer needs GIHON flowing—not just activity ([[PISHON|Pishon]]) or doctrine ([[HIDDEKEL|Hiddekel]]) but the DEEP WORK of Spirit in the hidden places. This is not emotionalism; it's the necessary oxygenation of the blood at the heart/lungs before it can be sent back out to the body.

#### Scripture(s):

- Genesis 2:13 — "The name of the second river is the Gihon. It is the one that flowed around the whole land of [[CUSH|Cush]]"
- Exodus 17:6 — "Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb, and you shall strike the rock, and water shall come out of it [gush forth like Gihon]"
- Psalm 42:7 — "Deep calls to deep at the roar of your waterfalls" (Gihon-depth calling)
- Romans 8:26 — "Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words"
- John 7:38 — "Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, 'Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water'" (plural rivers, including Gihon-depth)

#### Narrative Context:

The second of four rivers flowing from [[EDEN|Eden]]. The water bursting from rock in the wilderness. The deep-calling-to-deep of the psalmist. The Spirit's groaning intercession in believers. The rivers flowing from the believer's innermost being.
