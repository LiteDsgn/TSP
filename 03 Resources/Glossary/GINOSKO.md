# GINOSKO


#### Standard Meaning:

A Greek verb meaning "to know," "to understand," "to perceive," or "to recognize." One of two primary Greek words for knowledge (the other being OIDA).

#### Hebraic Meaning:

(through Greek lens):**
GINOSKO is EXPERIENTIAL, INTIMATE, PARTICIPATORY KNOWLEDGE—knowledge gained through direct encounter, relationship, and union. It is the Greek equivalent of Hebrew YADA (יָדַע), which describes UNION-KNOWLEDGE: knowing by experiencing, by participating, by becoming one with what is known. GINOSKO is not abstract information (that's gnosis) or mere intellectual assent, but RELATIONSHIP-KNOWLEDGE. When Scripture says "[[ADAM|Adam]] KNEW [yada/ginosko] Eve," it means sexual union—the most intimate knowing possible. When Jesus says "I NEVER KNEW [ginosko] you" (Matthew 7:23), He's not claiming ignorance of facts about them; He's describing absence of RELATIONAL UNION. GINOSKO is [[DA'AT]] (דַּעַת), not DATA—it's connection-knowledge, not binary information.

**Greek Linguistic Analysis:**
**GINOSKO (γινώσκω)** - Present active verb
- Perfect form: **GINOMAI (γίνομαι)** - "To become, to come into being"
- Noun form: **GNOSIS (γνῶσις)** - "Knowledge" (but often misunderstood as abstract)
- Distinguished from **OIDA (οἶδα)** - "To know" (perfect form, knowing by seeing/perceiving)
- GINOSKO implies progressive, experiential, growing knowledge

#### The Picture:

(conceptual):**
The knowledge that comes through EXPERIENCE, RELATIONSHIP, and UNION—like knowing a person by living with them, knowing a skill by practicing it, knowing a place by dwelling there. Not knowledge ABOUT something, but knowledge BY PARTICIPATING IN something.

#### My Insight:

GINOSKO is the key to understanding John 17:3—"And this is eternal life, that they know [ginosko] you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent." Eternal life IS ginosko-knowing of God—not information ABOUT God (anyone can have that), but EXPERIENTIAL UNION with God. This is [[DA'AT]] (union-knowledge) as opposed to DATA (binary information). When [[ADAM|Adam]] and Eve ate from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, they gained DATA (binary, dualistic, separating knowledge—this vs. that, me vs. you, good vs. evil) but LOST [[DA'AT]] (union-knowledge, experiential connection with Source). The entire Gospel is the restoration of [[DA'AT]]/GINOSKO. When Jesus says "I NEVER KNEW [ginosko] you; depart from me" (Matthew 7:23), He's not claiming factual ignorance—He knows everything. He's saying "You never experienced the UNION that was ontologically available. You lived in shell-consciousness (doing religious works) without awakening to seed-consciousness (the union we've always shared)." This is devastating because it means they spent their lives PERFORMING rather than EXPERIENCING, DOING rather than BEING. The "workers of lawlessness" (anomia—without law/[[TORAH|Torah]]) never looked in the MIRROR ([[TORAH|Torah]] as [[HIDDEKEL|Hiddekel]]) to see their true face. They never had GINOSKO. In Seed Protocol terms, GINOSKO is what happens when you AWAKEN to your position in Christ—not learning NEW information but RECOGNIZING reality that's always been true. Faith is GINOSKO—not intellectual assent to propositions but EXPERIENTIAL AWAKENING to union. [[ZAKAR]] (remembrance) produces GINOSKO (recognition of reality). The goal isn't to GET ginosko but to REALIZE you've always HAD it, you just weren't conscious of it. "That you may KNOW [ginosko] that you have eternal life" (1 John 5:13)—not "gain" but "know you have."

#### Scripture(s):

- John 17:3 — "And this is eternal life, that they know [ginosko] you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent"
- Matthew 7:23 — "And then will I declare to them, 'I never knew [ginosko] you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness'"
- 1 Corinthians 8:3 — "But if anyone loves God, he is known [ginosko, perfect passive] by God"
- Galatians 4:9 — "But now that you have come to know [ginosko] God, or rather to be known [ginosko] by God..."
- Philippians 3:10 — "that I may know [ginosko] him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death"
- 1 John 4:7 — "Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has been born of God and knows [ginosko] God"
- Genesis 4:1 (LXX) — "Now [[ADAM|Adam]] knew [ginosko/yada] Eve his wife, and she conceived" (ginosko as sexual union-knowledge)

#### Narrative Context:

Used throughout John's gospel and epistles for intimate knowledge of God. Paul's usage for experiential knowledge of Christ. The Septuagint's translation of Hebrew yada (to know intimately) as ginosko. The contrast between knowing ABOUT God (information) and KNOWING God (relationship/union).
