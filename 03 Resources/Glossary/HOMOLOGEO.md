# HOMOLOGEO

#### Standard Meaning:

A Greek word typically translated as "to confess" or "to acknowledge." Formed from homo (same) + logos (word/speech).

#### Hebraic Meaning:

Homologeo means TO SPEAK THE SAME WORD, TO AGREE WITH, TO ALIGN YOUR SPEECH WITH REALITY. It is not merely admitting facts - it is JOINING your voice to God's voice, your assessment to His assessment. To "confess Christ" is to AGREE with what God says about Christ. To "confess sin" is to AGREE with God's diagnosis. Homologeo is relational alignment, not just factual acknowledgment.

#### Paleo-Hebrew Linguistics:

(Greek word, but can be understood through Hebraic thought patterns)

- **Homo**: Same, Together, Unified
    
- **Logos**: Word, Speech, Reason, Divine Expression
    

#### The Picture:


Speaking the SAME WORD (Logos) together with God. When you homologeo, you are harmonizing your understanding with God's revelation. You are "getting on the same page" with divine truth.

#### My Insight:

**Homologeo is the key** to understanding what "confession" actually means. It's not begging God to accept what you're saying - it's AGREEING with what God has already said. When Romans 10:9 says "if you confess [homologeo] with your mouth that Jesus is Lord," it's not asking you to inform God of something new - it's inviting you to ALIGN yourself with the reality God has declared. This connects perfectly to your theology of faith as awakening: you're not creating reality by your confession; you're RECOGNIZING reality that already exists. When you "confess your sins" (1 John 1:9), you're not telling God what He doesn't know - you're AGREEING with His diagnosis that you twisted away from the Source (Chata). Your confession doesn't make you forgiven; it ACKNOWLEDGES the forgiveness that's already yours in Christ. This is why the gospel is an ANNOUNCEMENT, not a negotiation. God has spoken (Logos). Our response is to Homologeo - to add our "Amen" to His declaration. The verb is relational, covenantal, and participatory. You're joining the conversation God is already having about Himself and His work.

#### Scripture(s):


- Romans 10:9 - "If you confess [homologeo] with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved"
    
- 1 John 1:9 - "If we confess [homologeo] our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive"
    
- 1 John 4:15 - "Whoever confesses [homologeo] that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him"
    
- Matthew 10:32 - "Everyone who acknowledges [homologeo] me before men, I also will acknowledge before my Father"
    

#### Narrative Context:

Used by Paul to describe the verbal component of saving faith. Applied by John to describe ongoing fellowship with God and others. Central to apostolic preaching about Christ's lordship.
