**Standard Meaning:** The Hebrew verb meaning "to cut." Most commonly used in the phrase "karath berit" (to cut a covenant).

**Hebraic Meaning:** Karath is the VIOLENT, BLOODY, IRREVERSIBLE act of establishing covenant. Cutting a covenant involves cutting animals, walking through blood, and binding oneself to another through death-oath. Karath implies that the covenant is sealed by sacrifice—it cannot be casually broken. To "cut covenant" is to say, "May I be torn apart like these animals if I violate this oath."

**Paleo-Hebrew Linguistics:**

- **Kaf (כ)**: Palm of hand, Open hand—To cover, Subdue, Tame
    
- **Resh (ר)**: Head of man—Chief, Person, Beginning
    
- **Tav (ת)**: Cross, Mark—Sign, Covenant, Seal
    

**The Picture:**

The HAND (Kaf) of the CHIEF/HEAD (Resh) making a COVENANT MARK (Tav). Karath is the action of the authority figure using his power to establish a binding agreement that is marked by a visible sign (the cut, the blood, the sacrifice).

**My Insight:** Karath is essential to your Monergistic theology because it shows that covenants are not mutual agreements between equals—they are established by the stronger party FOR the weaker party. In Genesis 15, God tells Abraham to cut the animals, but then God walks through ALONE while Abraham sleeps. God "cut" the covenant unilaterally. This is the foundation of grace: God committed Himself through blood-oath, and humanity contributed nothing but the need. The New Covenant (Jeremiah 31:31—"Behold, I will cut a new covenant") is the same pattern: God does the cutting (Christ's body on the Cross), and we receive the benefits. The Hebrew phrase "karath berit" appears over 80 times in the Old Testament, always emphasizing the solemnity and blood-cost of covenant. When Jesus says "This cup is the new covenant in my blood" (Luke 22:20), He is declaring that His body is being "cut" (karath) to establish the eternal covenant. Your theology shows that every covenant in Scripture points to the ultimate Karath at Calvary—where God's Son was CUT (wounded, pierced, torn) to seal the promise God made before time began. We don't cut covenant with God; God cuts covenant FOR us, and we participate by being brought INSIDE the covenant that was already sealed.

**Scripture(s):**

- Genesis 15:18 — "On that day the LORD cut [karath] a covenant with Abram"
    
- Jeremiah 31:31 — "Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will cut a new covenant"
    
- Luke 22:20 — "This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood"
    
- Hebrews 9:15-22 — "For where a covenant is, there must of necessity be the death of the one who made it" (Karath principle)
    

**Narrative Context:** Used throughout the Old Testament to describe God's covenant-making with Abraham, Moses, and David. Applied by Jesus to His own death. Explained by the author of Hebrews as the theological foundation of the New Covenant.
