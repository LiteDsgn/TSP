# KRINO (κρίνω)


#### Standard Meaning:

A Greek verb meaning "to judge," "to decide," "to condemn," or "to separate." Used throughout the New Testament for judgment, discernment, and the act of making distinctions or divisions.

#### Hebraic Meaning:

(through Greek lens):**
KRINO is THE ACT OF SEPARATION OR DISTINCTION - not primarily punitive judgment but the function of DIVIDING, DISCERNING, DISTINGUISHING one thing from another. The root concept is SEPARATION. When applied to divine judgment, it represents GOD REVEALING WHAT WAS HIDDEN, separating truth from deception, light from darkness, seed from shell. It is not God imposing arbitrary punishment but God MAKING MANIFEST the reality that was always present. KRINO is ontologically descriptive rather than legally prescriptive - it describes the state of being SEPARATED (from Source, from union, from true identity) rather than declaring a sentence of punishment.

**Greek Linguistic Analysis:**
**KRINO (κρίνω)** - Root verb
- Related to **[[KRISIS]] (κρίσις):** "judgment, separation, decision, crisis"
- Related to **KRIMA (κρίμα):** "judgment, sentence, condemnation"
- Related to **KRITES (κριτής):** "judge, one who separates/decides"

#### The Picture:

(conceptual):**
The act of SEPARATING, DISTINGUISHING, or MAKING A DIVISION between two things. In ancient usage, krino was used for: (1) Separating grain from chaff, (2) Judging a legal case (separating guilty from innocent), (3) Making a decision (separating one option from another), (4) Discerning quality (separating good from bad).

#### My Insight:

KRINO is critical for understanding New Testament "judgment" language through Hebrew rather than Western legal frameworks. When John 3:18 says "whoever does not believe is CONDEMNED [kekritai - perfect passive of krino] already," it's not describing future sentencing but present STATE - they ARE (already, currently) in a state of SEPARATION. The perfect tense indicates a completed action with ongoing results: they HAVE BEEN separated and remain in that separated state. This is [[NASHA]] (displacement-consciousness), not divine punishment. The judgment isn't God CREATING separation; it's God REVEALING separation that's already operative. When Jesus says "For judgment ([[KRISIS|krisis]]) I came into this world, that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind" (John 9:39), He's describing judgment as REVELATION - the light arriving exposes/separates truth from deception, humility from pride, seed from shell. KRINO is what the [[LAHAT]] (flaming sword) does - it SEPARATES the dross from the gold, burning away what's not essential (shell) and leaving what is essential (seed). The [[KERUVIM]] perform krino-function: they separate/distinguish between shell-consciousness (First [[ADAM|Adam]]) that cannot enter [[EDEN|Eden]] and seed-consciousness (Last [[ADAM|Adam]]) that can. Understanding krino as SEPARATION rather than SENTENCING transforms our reading of judgment passages: God isn't imposing external punishment; He's REVEALING internal reality, EXPOSING what was hidden, SEPARATING what was mixed, until only truth remains.

#### Scripture(s):

- John 3:17-18 - "For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn [krinō] the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned [krinō], but whoever does not believe is condemned [kekritai - perfect passive] already"
- John 9:39 - "Jesus said, 'For judgment ([[KRISIS|krisis]], from krinō) I came into this world, that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind'"
- John 12:31 - "Now is the judgment ([[KRISIS|krisis]]) of this world; now will the ruler of this world be cast out"
- Romans 14:13 - "Therefore let us not pass judgment [krinō] on one another any longer, but rather decide [krinō - same word, different context] never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother"
- 1 Corinthians 11:31 - "But if we judged [diekrinomen - discerned/separated] ourselves truly, we would not be judged [krinō]"

#### Narrative Context:

Used throughout the Gospels for Jesus's teaching on judgment. Paul's usage in Romans and Corinthians for both divine judgment and human discernment. The Book of Revelation's descriptions of final judgment/separation. Always carrying the core meaning of SEPARATION/DISTINCTION rather than purely punitive action.
