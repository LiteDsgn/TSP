# KRISIS (κρίσις)


#### Standard Meaning:

A Greek noun meaning "judgment," "decision," "crisis," or "separation." The root from which we get the English word "crisis." Used in the New Testament for both divine judgment and the act of making critical distinctions.

#### Hebraic Meaning:

(through Greek lens):**
KRISIS is THE STATE OF SEPARATION or THE CRISIS POINT where distinction becomes visible. It is not primarily a legal verdict but a REVELATORY MOMENT when what was hidden becomes manifest, when what was mixed becomes separated, when truth is distinguished from deception. KRISIS is the CRISIS—the turning point, the decisive moment, the emergency that forces clarity. In divine context, krisis is the ARRIVAL OF LIGHT that creates automatic separation: those who love darkness flee from it, those who love light come toward it (John 3:19-21). The light itself IS the judgment; no external sentencing required.

**Greek Linguistic Analysis:**
**KRISIS (κρίσις)** - Noun form of krinō
- Can mean: "judgment, decision, lawsuit, condemnation, crisis, turning point"
- Related to medical term "crisis" (the turning point in a disease)
- Carries connotation of DECISIVE MOMENT when separation occurs

#### The Picture:

(conceptual):**
The CRITICAL MOMENT or STATE where separation/distinction becomes inevitable and visible. Like a fever breaking (medical crisis), a [[DAM|dam]] bursting (pressure crisis), or a seed shell cracking (germination crisis)—the point where hidden tension becomes manifest change.

#### My Insight:

KRISIS is even more explicitly about SEPARATION than [[KRINO|krino]]. When John 3:19 says "this IS the judgment [krisis]: the light has come into the world," Jesus is defining what judgment actually IS—not a future courtroom scene but the PRESENT REALITY of light's arrival forcing a crisis/separation. The light doesn't "judge" in the sense of pronouncing verdicts; the light judges by BEING LIGHT. Those in shell-consciousness (loving darkness) automatically flee from exposure. Those in seed-consciousness (loving truth) automatically come toward revelation. The KRISIS is the automatic separation that occurs when truth arrives. This is why Jesus can say "I came not to judge [krinō] the world but to save the world" (John 12:47) while also saying "for judgment [krisis] I came into this world" (John 9:39)—because the krisis isn't Him pronouncing sentences but His PRESENCE forcing the crisis that reveals reality. In Seed Protocol terms: KRISIS is the moment when the [[LAHAT]] (fire) touches the seed, when the [[KERUVIM]] perform their separating function, when shell-consciousness is exposed as shell and seed-reality is revealed as seed. The "crisis" is painful for those identified with shell (they experience it as condemnation) but liberating for those awakening to seed-nature (they experience it as salvation). Same event, different experience based on consciousness level. KRISIS is unavoidable because truth WILL separate from deception, seed WILL separate from shell, [[YESH|Yesh]] WILL separate from [[HAVEL|Havel]]. The only question is whether you IDENTIFY with what's being burned away or with what's being revealed.

#### Scripture(s):

- John 3:19 — "And this is the judgment [krisis]: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light"
- John 5:24 — "Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment [krisis], but has passed from death to life"
- John 9:39 — "Jesus said, 'For judgment [krisis] I came into this world, that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind'"
- John 12:31 — "Now is the judgment [krisis] of this world; now will the ruler of this world be cast out"
- Matthew 12:36 — "I tell you, on the day of judgment [krisis] people will give account for every careless word they speak"
- Hebrews 9:27 — "And just as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment [krisis]"

#### Narrative Context:

Jesus's teaching on the nature of judgment as light's arrival. The present reality of judgment/separation happening now, not just future. The unavoidable crisis point where truth becomes manifest. Paul and Hebrews referencing the decisive moment of revelation.
