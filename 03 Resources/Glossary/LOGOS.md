# LOGOS

#### Standard Meaning:

A Greek word meaning "word," "speech," "reason," "logic," or "principle." Used extensively in Greek philosophy for the order of the cosmos.

#### Hebraic Meaning:

(as used in John 1):** As used by John (bridging to _Dabar_), Logos is not an abstract philosophical principle but **Ontological Self-Expression**. It is the rational structure of reality, the coherence holding the "One Substance" together, revealed as a **Person**. It is the "Logic" by which the Infinite (Aleph) makes itself intelligible to the Finite (Dam) without ceasing to be Infinite.

**Greek Philosophical Background:**

- **Heraclitus (~500 BC):** Logos is the rational principle governing the cosmos, the fire that orders chaos
    
- **Plato (~400 BC):** Logos is the eternal Form/Idea that the material world imitates
    
- **Stoics (~300 BC):** Logos is the divine reason permeating all things, the soul of the universe
    

**The Revolutionary Shift:** All Greek philosophy treated Logos as **impersonal** - a principle, a force, a law.

**John's Scandal:** "The Logos **became flesh**" (John 1:14)

This is **philosophically outrageous**:

- The Eternal became temporal
    
- The Infinite became finite
    
- The Abstract became concrete
    
- **Reason itself took human form**
    

#### The Picture:

John reveals the Logos as the **Son** - the "Speech" of the Father.:

- The **Logic** by which reality coheres (Colossians 1:17 - "in him all things hold together")
    
- The **Word** that spoke creation into being (Genesis 1, applied to Christ)
    
- The **Reason** that makes existence intelligible
    
- The **Expression** of the Father's invisible nature (Hebrews 1:3 - "the exact imprint of his nature")
    

#### My Insight:

In the Yesh-Echad framework, Logos reveals the **structure of the Trinity** embedded in the nature of communication itself.

**The Triune Pattern of Logos:**

1. **The Speaker (Father):** The Source, the Hidden, the Unspoken Depth (Nistar)
    
2. **The Speech (Logos/Son):** The Expression, the Revelation, the Manifest Form (Nigleh)
    
3. **The Breath/Hearing/Understanding (Spirit):** The Reception, the Connection, the Bridge between Speaker and Hearer
    

You cannot have a "word" without:

- A **Mind** that conceives (Father)
    
- An **Expression** that communicates (Son)
    
- A **Medium** that carries (Spirit)
    

**This is not three "parts" of God - it is the tri-unity of how Being manifests.**

**When John says "the Logos was with God and the Logos was God" (John 1:1), he is revealing:**

- The Logos is **distinct** from the Father (with God)
    
- The Logos is **identical** to the Father in essence (was God)
    
- This is **Echad** (composite unity) - not division, but **relationship within oneness**
    

Jesus as Logos means He is the **Architecture of Reality**. When He says "I AM," He is not just claiming divinity; He is revealing the structure of the universe.

- "I AM the Truth" = I am the Cylinder of Reality.
    
- "I AM the Door" = I am the Dalet/Dabar.This supports the "Participatory (Da’at)" principle: We don't analyze the Logos from the outside; we inhabit the Logos as the structure of our own existence ("In Him we live and move").
    

**Application to Divine Communication:** The Logos-doctrine means God's "speech" is never merely **informational**. It is always **ontological**.

When God speaks through:

- **Creation** (Genesis 1) - the Logos creates
    
- **Scripture** (Hebrews 1:1) - the Logos reveals
    
- **Incarnation** (John 1:14) - the Logos becomes experienceable
    
- **Your awakening** (Ephesians 1:17-18) - the Logos opens eyes
    

**None of these are "different words" - they are the ONE Logos manifesting in different modes.**

#### Scripture(s):


- **John 1:1** - "In the beginning was the Word [Logos], and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."
    
- **John 1:14** - "And the Word [Logos] became flesh and dwelt among us."
    
- **Colossians 1:15-17** - "He is the image of the invisible God... by him all things were created... in him all things hold together."
    
- **Hebrews 1:1-3** - "In these last days he has spoken to us by his Son... he upholds the universe by the word [rhema] of his power."
    
- **Revelation 19:13** - "He is clothed in a robe dipped in blood, and the name by which he is called is The Word [Logos] of God."
    

#### Narrative Context:

The Prologue of John, establishing that the Historical Jesus is the Eternal Logic of God - the _Zera_ (Seed) that contains the whole tree of reality.
