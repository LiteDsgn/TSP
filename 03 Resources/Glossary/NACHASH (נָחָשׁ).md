# NACHASH (נָחָשׁ)

#### Standard Meaning:


"Serpent," "Snake." Also related to the word for "Divination" or "Whispering."

#### Hebraic Meaning:


The Nachash is the AGENT OF DUALITY. He is the "Whisperer" who suggests that there is a reality outside of God. He introduces the logic of "God vs. You" (Binary Logic). He is not a rival creator; he is the catalyst for the test of the Seed.

#### Paleo-Hebrew Linguistics:


- Nun (נ): Seed—Life, Heir
    
- Chet (ח): Fence—Separation, Wall
    
- Shin (ש): Teeth—Press, Destroy, Consume
    

#### The Picture:


The SEED (Nun) SEPARATED (Chet) and CONSUMED/DESTROYED (Shin). Or: The one who seeks to Separate and Devour the Seed.

#### My Insight:


In your Non-Dual framework, the Nachash represents the "Mind of the Flesh" or the "False Logic." He sold Eve the lie that she was "lacking" (Havel) and needed to "do something" to become like God. This created the Illusion of Separation. The Nachash is the architect of the binary world (Good vs. Evil) that blinded Adam to the Unity (Echad) of God.

#### Scripture(s):


- Genesis 3:1 — "Now the serpent [Nachash] was more crafty than any other beast."
    
- Numbers 21:9 — "Moses made a bronze serpent [Nachash]..." (The agent of death becomes the sign of healing when lifted up/exposed).
    

#### Narrative Context:


The tempter in Eden. The symbol of chaos and judgment throughout Scripture.
