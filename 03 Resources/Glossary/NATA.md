**Standard Meaning:**
"To plant," "to establish," "to fix in place." Used in agricultural contexts for planting trees, vineyards, or gardens.

**Hebraic Meaning:**
NATA is DELIBERATE ENCLOSURE FOR REVELATION, not casual scattering of seeds. It represents the intentional act of God surrounding the Seed (humanity) with specific conditions so it can be seen, experienced, and brought to fruition. In Hebraic thought, planting is an act of faith and covenant—the planter commits to a long-term relationship with what is planted, providing ongoing care through the germination process. NATA implies ownership, protection, and purposeful positioning.

**Paleo-Hebrew Linguistics:**
- **Nun (נ):** Seed—Life, Heir, Continuity
- **Tet (ט):** Basket, Surround—To contain, protect, encircle
- **Ayin (ע):** Eye—To see, experience, watch

**The Picture:**
The SEED (Nun) SURROUNDED/CONTAINED (Tet) to be SEEN/EXPERIENCED (Ayin). NATA is the act of deliberately enclosing the seed within protective conditions so that it can be observed, experienced, and brought to full manifestation. Or: The LIFE (Nun) placed in a CONTAINER (Tet) for the purpose of REVELATION (Ayin).

**My Insight:**
NATA is the foundational act of the Seed Protocol. When Genesis 2:8 says "YHVH Elohim PLANTED a garden in [[EDEN|Eden]]," this is not casual landscaping—this is God deliberately enclosing humanity (the Seed) within specific conditions (the Garden) for the express purpose of REVELATION (so the Seed can be seen/experienced). The planting is MONERGISTIC (God alone does it), INTENTIONAL (not reactive), and REVELATORY (designed to make visible what was hidden). Every act of planting implies: (1) The planter knows what the seed contains, (2) The planter prepares appropriate conditions, (3) The planter commits to seeing the process through to harvest. This destroys the narrative that the Fall was an accident requiring Plan B. God PLANTED knowing exactly what would happen—the descent into soil, the shell-cracking, the germination in darkness. NATA is covenant language: "I am establishing you in this position, and I will not abandon you until the fruit emerges." When applied to believers, we are not wandering seeds hoping to land in good soil—we are NATA'd, deliberately positioned by the Sower in the exact conditions necessary for our germination.

**Scripture(s):**
- Genesis 2:8 — "And the LORD God planted [nata] a garden in [[EDEN|Eden]], in the east, and there he put the man whom he had formed"
- Psalm 1:3 — "He is like a tree planted [nata] by streams of water that yields its fruit in its season"
- Jeremiah 24:6 — "I will set my eyes on them for good, and I will bring them back to this land. I will build them up, and not tear them down; I will plant [nata] them, and not pluck them up"
- Isaiah 61:3 — "...that they may be called oaks of righteousness, the planting [matta, from nata] of the LORD, that he may be glorified"
- Amos 9:15 — "I will plant [nata] them on their land, and they shall never again be uprooted out of the land that I have given them"

**Narrative Context:**
The act of God establishing the Garden in [[EDEN|Eden]]. The promise of restoration in the prophets—God replanting His people. The Messianic imagery of believers as trees planted by God. The assurance that what God plants, He will not uproot.
