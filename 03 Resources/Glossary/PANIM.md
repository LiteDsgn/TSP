# PANIM (פָּנִים)

#### Standard Meaning:


"Face," "Faces," "Presence."

#### Hebraic Meaning:


Panim is always plural, implying the multifaceted nature of presence. To seek someone's Panim is to seek direct, unmediated interaction. It is the opposite of "Back" (History/After-effects). Panim is the Now of relationship.

#### Paleo-Hebrew Linguistics:


- Pey (פ): Mouth—Speech, Edge
    
- Nun (נ): Seed—Life, Heir
    
- Yod (י): Hand—Work, Deed
    
- Mem (ם): Water—Chaos, Massivity
    

#### The Picture:


The MOUTH (Pey) SPEAKING LIFE (Nun) through DEEDS (Yod) in the CHAOS (Mem).Insight: God's Presence is His active speaking and working of life into our reality.

#### My Insight:


This validates your "You + I" theory. In Exodus, God speaks to Moses "Face to Face" (Panim el Panim). In a mirror, you see your own face. Radical Non-Dualism suggests that when we gaze into the Panim of God, we find our true Identity. We are the reflection of His Face in the world. The "Beatific Vision" is a moment of Recognition—realizing that the Face you are looking for is the Source of the Face you are wearing (Tselem).

#### Scripture(s):


- Exodus 33:14 — "My presence [Panim] will go with you, and I will give you rest."
    
- Psalm 27:8 — "Your face [Panim], LORD, do I seek."
    
- Numbers 6:25 — "The LORD make his face [Panim] to shine upon you."
    

#### Narrative Context:


The ultimate goal of the Covenant—to dwell in God's face/presence. The defining mark of the Tabernacle.
