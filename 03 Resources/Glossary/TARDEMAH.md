# TARDEMAH (תַּרְדֵּמָה)

#### Standard Meaning:

"Deep Sleep," "Trance," "Stupor." Used to describe the state Adam was in when Eve was created (_Genesis_ 2:21).

#### Hebraic Meaning:

TARDEMAH** is not ordinary sleep but **MINI-MAVET**, a prophetic death-trance that anticipates the full death-and-resurrection pattern. **_It is the state of unconsciousness where GOD WORKS ALONE, where the vessel contributes NOTHING, where MONERGISM is demonstrated in its purest form._** **In the Yesh-Echad framework,** **TARDEMAH** represents the **DESIGNED** **PASSIVITY** necessary for transformation, the deep sleep during which God performs surgery, cuts the side, removes the rib, and creates the Ezer without any contribution from the one being operated upon.

#### Paleo-Hebrew Linguistics:


- **Tav (ת):** Cross, _Mark_, Covenant, Sign
    
- **Resh (ר):** Head, Person, Chief, Beginning
    
- **Dalet (ד):** Door, Pathway, Entrance, Movement
    
- **Mem (מ):** Water, Chaos, Massive, Unknown
    
- **Hey (ה):** Behold, Reveal, Breath, Window
    

#### The Picture:

The COVENANT MARK (Tav) on the HEAD/PERSON (Resh) creating a DOOR (Dalet) through CHAOS (Mem) to REVELATION (Hey). TARDEMAH is the covenant-marked state that opens the pathway through chaotic transformation to manifestation_. Or:_ **The SIGN (Tav) upon the CHIEF (Resh) enabling MOVEMENT (Dalet) through UNKNOWN DEPTHS (Mem) to BEHOLD (Hey) what emerges.**

#### My Insight:

TARDEMAH** is the **MONERGISTIC** **SURGERY** **PATTERN** that repeats throughout Scripture and reaches its climax at the Cross. **_When God causes TARDEMAH to fall upon Adam (Genesis 2:21), it establishes the principle: TRANSFORMATION HAPPENS DURING UNCONSCIOUSNESS, WHILE GOD WORKS ALONE._** Adam contributes **NOTHING** to the creation of Eve. He is passive, asleep, unaware. God performs the surgery, cuts (Karath) the side, removes the structure (tsela, rib/side/chamber), forms the Ezer from **WITHIN** Adam's own substance. When Adam awakens, the solution to his aloneness is **ALREADY** **PROVIDED**. He didn't ask for it, didn't work for it, didn't even know he needed it until God diagnosed the **NOT-TOV** condition. **This pattern** **PERFECTLY** **ANTICIPATES** **THE** **CROSS**: Christ enters **ACTUAL** Mavet (death, the full version of what Tardemah previewed). His side is **PIERCED** (_John_ 19:34). From His opened side flows **BLOOD** and **WATER**. The Church/Bride is formed **FROM** Him, **FROM** His own substance, while He is "asleep" in death. When He rises (awakens from death), the Bride is already formed, already His, "bone of His bone, flesh of His flesh." The **TARDEMAH** pattern proves that salvation is **MONERGISTIC**, God working alone while we are helpless/unconscious/dead. We don't contribute, don't cooperate, don't assist. We are the **PATIENT** on the operating table, not the **SURGEON**. When we "wake up" (faith/Zakar/remembrance), we discover the work is **ALREADY** **DONE**.

#### Scripture(s):


- **Genesis 2:21;** "So the LORD God caused a tardemah to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs"
    
- **Genesis 15:12;** "As the sun was going down, a tardemah fell on Abram. And behold, dreadful and great darkness fell upon him" (God cutting covenant alone while Abraham sleeps)
    
- **1 Samuel 26:12;** "So David took the spear and the jar of water from Saul's head, and they went away. No man saw it or knew it, nor did any awake, for they were all asleep, because a tardemah from the LORD had fallen upon them"
    
- **Isaiah 29:10;** "For the LORD has poured out upon you a spirit of tardemah, and has closed your eyes (the prophets)"
    
- **Job 4:13;** "Amid thoughts from visions of the night, when tardemah falls on men"
    

#### Narrative Context:

The deep sleep during Eve's creation. The trance during Abraham's covenant-cutting ceremony. The supernatural sleep on Saul's camp when David could have killed him. The prophetic stupor of judgment. The pattern fulfilled at Christ's death when the Bride is formed from His pierced side.
