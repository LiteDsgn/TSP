**Standard Meaning:** "Continual," "Perpetual," "Always." Used for the daily sacrifices and the menorah light.

**Hebraic Meaning:** _Temid_ is the **STEADY STATE OF YESH**. It describes the **Background Frequency** of the Covenant. While human consciousness fluctuates (we sleep, we wake, we sin, we repent), the Divine Reality remains _Temid_—uninterrupted. In your framework, _Temid_ is the **Constant Variable** in the equation of reality.

**Paleo-Hebrew Linguistics:**

- Tav (ת): Cross—Mark, Covenant, Sign
    
- Mem (ם): Water—Chaos, Flow, History
    
- Yod (י): Hand—Work, Deed
    
- Dalet (ד): Door—Entrance, Pathway
    

**The Picture:** The COVENANT (Tav) flowing through CHAOS (Mem) by WORK (Yod) to keep the DOOR (Dalet) open. _Or:_ **The Constant Work of the Covenant in the Chaos.**

**My Insight:** My theology emphasizes that we don't "start and stop" being with God. The Union is Temid. This entry comforts the "Fallen" consciousness. The Ego feels like its connection to God is broken when it sins or forgets. But the **Yesh-Echad** reality is _Temid_. The "Fire on the Altar" (Leviticus 6:13) was never allowed to go out. This symbolizes that the **Union** between God (_Aleph_) and Man (_Dam_) is sustained by God, not Man. This represents the Yesh—the substance of God that sustains us even when we are sleeping or unaware. Your "Seed Theory" relies on this: Even when the Seed is buried in the dark soil (_Mavet_) and seems dead, the Life force within it is _Temid_. We fall into Havel (forgetfulness), but God remains Temid (Continual). It is working continually, even in the silence. Salvation is not restarting the engine; it is realizing the engine never stopped running. Faith is simply tuning back into the Temid frequency.

  

**Scripture(s):**

- **Exodus 27:20** — "To keep the lamp burning regularly [Temid]."
    
- **Isaiah 58:11** — "The LORD will guide you continually [Temid]."
    
- **Hebrews 7:25** — "He always [Temid] lives to make intercession for them."
    
- **Psalm 16:8** — "I have set the LORD always [Temid] before me."
    

**Narrative Context:**

Describes the daily maintenance of the Temple service, symbolizing the uninterrupted relationship between God and Israel. The definition of Daniel's God ("The God whom you serve continually").
