# TSELA (צֵלָע)

#### Standard Meaning:

"Rib," "Side," "Chamber," "Beam." Used in _Genesis_ 2:21-22 for what God took from Adam to create Eve.

#### Hebraic Meaning:

TSELA** is not merely a rib bone but a **STRUCTURAL** **CHAMBER** or **SIDE**, a significant portion of the body, possibly referring to an entire side of the body. The same word is used for the **SIDE** **CHAMBERS** of the Temple (_1 Kings_ 6:5), suggesting this is architectural language about structure and support. **In the Yesh-Echad framework,** **TSELA** represents the **SUBSTANCE** **FROM** **WITHIN** from which the Ezer is formed. It proves that woman is not secondary creation from different material but **SAME** **SUBSTANCE** as man, taken from his own body during **TARDEMAH** (deep sleep/mini-death).

#### Paleo-Hebrew Linguistics:


- **Tzade (צ):** Fishhook, Side, To Capture, Hunt, Pull From
    
- **Lamed (ל):** Shepherd's Staff, Authority, Direction, Control
    
- **Ayin (ע):** Eye, To See, Watch, Experience
    

#### The Picture:

That which is PULLED FROM (Tzade) the AUTHORITY/STRUCTURE (Lamed) to be SEEN/MANIFEST (Ayin). TSELA is the part extracted from the chief/authority to become visible as separate yet connected entity. _Or:_ **The SIDE (Tzade) that DIRECTS/SUPPORTS (Lamed) what is BEHELD (Ayin).**

#### My Insight:

The **TSELA** is the prophetic prefigurement of Christ's **PIERCED** **SIDE**. **_When God takes the tsela from Adam during Tardemah (deep sleep), it establishes the pattern: the EZER (helper/bride) comes FROM the opened side of the one in death-sleep, formed from his own substance._** **This pattern** reaches fulfillment at the Cross: Christ enters Mavet (actual death, not just sleep). His **SIDE** is **PIERCED** (_John_ 19:34, the Greek word is pleura, equivalent to Hebrew tsela). From the opened side flows **BLOOD** and **WATER**, the substances of life and cleansing. The **CHURCH**/**BRIDE** is formed from Christ's own substance, from His opened side, while He is in the tomb ("asleep" in death). She is not different substance but **SAME** **SUBSTANCE**, bone of His bone, flesh of His flesh. The tsela proves **ECHAD** (composite unity): man and woman are not two separate creations from different materials but **ONE** **FLESH** because she came **FROM** him. Similarly, Christ and Church are **ONE** **BODY** because she came **FROM** Him. The removal of the tsela caused a "wound" in Adam that was only "healed" when Eve stood beside him, the missing part returned in new form. Christ's pierced side is the "wound" through which the Bride emerges, and it remains as the eternal testimony of the price paid (_Revelation_ 5:6, "a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain"). The tsela is the **ARCHITECTURAL** **SUPPORT** removed and reformed, what was internal structure becomes external helper, what was hidden within becomes manifest without, yet both remain one substance.

#### Scripture(s):


- **Genesis 2:21-22;** "So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man... and he took one of his ribs [tsela] and closed up its place with flesh. And the rib [tsela] that the LORD God had taken from the man he made into a woman"
    
- **1 Kings 6:5-6;** "He also built a structure against the wall of the house, running around... And he made side chambers [tsela'ot, plural of tsela] all around"
    
- **Exodus 25:12;** "You shall cast four rings of gold for it and put them on its four feet, two rings on the one side [tsela] of it"
    
- **Exodus 26:20;** "And for the second side [tsela] of the tabernacle, on the north side"
    
- **John 19:34;** "But one of the soldiers pierced his side [pleura, Greek for tsela] with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water"
    

#### Narrative Context:

The creation of Eve from Adam's tsela during Tardemah. The architectural structure of the Tabernacle using tsela'ot (side chambers). The piercing of Christ's tsela on the Cross from which the Church emerges.
