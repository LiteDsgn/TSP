# TZAR (צַר)

#### Standard Meaning:

A Hebrew word meaning "narrow," "tight," "distress," or "enemy." Can refer to physical constriction or emotional/spiritual anguish.

#### Hebraic Meaning:

Tzar is CONSTRICTION, SUFFOCATION, THE NARROWING OF LIFE UNTIL IT IS EXTINGUISHED. It represents both the enemy that oppresses you and the internal state of being squeezed, trapped, unable to breathe. Tzar is the opposite of Yasha (wide space/deliverance) - it is the crushing pressure of sin, death, and judgment. To be in Tzar is to have no room to move, no space to breathe, no path to escape.

#### Paleo-Hebrew Linguistics:


- **Tzade (צ)**: Fishhook, Side - To hunt, Capture, Trap
    
- **Resh (ר)**: Head of man - Person, Chief, Top
    

#### The Picture:


The PERSON (Resh) who is TRAPPED/CAPTURED (Tzade). Tzar is the image of being caught, snared, with walls closing in. It is confinement, restriction, the narrowing of possibilities until there is no way out.

#### My Insight:

Tzar is essential to understanding the Cross because crucifixion is the ULTIMATE PHYSICAL DEFINITION of Tzar. When a person is crucified, their chest cavity is compressed - they cannot breathe without pushing up on the nails in their feet. It is slow suffocation, the progressive NARROWING of life. Jesus entered the ultimate Tzar - the most constricted, crushing death possible. He experienced Tzar on every level: physically (unable to breathe), emotionally (abandoned by disciples), spiritually (forsaken by the Father). He took the "narrowness" of judgment so that He could explode the gates open into Yasha (wide space). Psalm 118:5 is prophetic of this: "Out of my distress [Tzar] I called on the LORD; the LORD answered me and set me in a broad place [Merchav/Yasha]." Jesus LIVED this verse on the Cross - He called out from ultimate Tzar ("My God, why have you forsaken me?") and was answered by resurrection into ultimate Yasha (seated at the right hand of God). This demonstrates that He took OUR Tzar (the enemy - Satan, sin, death - pressing in on us) so that we could experience HIS Yasha (wide, spacious, abundant life). This is why salvation is described as being "delivered from the enemy" - the enemy is the Tzar, the constriction, and Christ absorbed it all.

#### Scripture(s):


- Psalm 118:5 - "Out of my distress [Tzar] I called on the LORD; the LORD answered me and set me in a broad place"
    
- Psalm 4:1 - "You have given me relief [made wide] when I was in distress [Tzar]"
    
- 2 Corinthians 4:8 - "We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair" (Living through Tzar without being destroyed by it)
    

#### Narrative Context:

Used throughout the Psalms to describe the anguish of persecution and oppression. Applied prophetically to the Messiah's suffering. Experienced literally by Christ on the Cross.
