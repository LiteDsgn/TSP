# YADAH (יָדַע)

#### Standard Meaning:

The Hebrew verb meaning "to know." Can refer to intellectual knowledge, experiential knowledge, or intimate relational knowledge.

#### Hebraic Meaning:

Yadah is INTIMATE, EXPERIENTIAL, RELATIONAL KNOWING—not just facts in the mind, but knowledge that comes through encounter, relationship, and union. The same word is used for sexual intimacy (Genesis 4:1—"Adam knew [yadah] Eve"), which shows that Yadah is about DEEP CONNECTION, not surface information. To "know" God is to be in covenant relationship with Him, to experience His character firsthand.

#### Paleo-Hebrew Linguistics:


- **Yod (י)**: Hand, Arm—Work, Deed, Possession
    
- **Dalet (ד)**: Door—Opening, Pathway, Entrance
    
- **Ayin (ע)**: Eye—To see, Watch, Experience
    

#### The Picture:


The HAND (Yod) that opens the DOOR (Dalet) to the EYE (Ayin)—or, the hand that opens your eyes to truly SEE. Yadah is knowledge gained through direct encounter, through "touching" reality, through the opening of perception. It is experiential, participatory knowledge.

#### My Insight:

Yadah is central to your theology of the New Covenant because Jeremiah 31:34 promises: "They shall all know [yadah] me, from the least of them to the greatest." This is not intellectual information—it is INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP. The difference between the Old and New Covenants is not the content (God has always been the same), but the ACCESS: now, through the Spirit, EVERYONE has direct, intimate knowledge (yadah) of God. This is why your framework emphasizes that the Name is RELATIONAL, not informational. You don't "know God's Name" by learning syllables—you "know God's Name" by being in covenant relationship with Him (yadah). This connects to faith as awakening: faith is not accumulating information ABOUT God; it is waking up to the fact that you ALREADY KNOW (yadah) Him because you've been held in Him since before the foundation of the world (Ephesians 1:4). Jesus embodies Yadah—He says "I know [ginosko—Greek equivalent] my sheep and my sheep know me" (John 10:14). This is mutual, intimate, covenant knowledge. When you "know" Christ, you're not just agreeing with facts—you're PARTICIPATING in His life, being united to Him, experiencing His reality from the inside.

#### Scripture(s):


- Genesis 4:1 — "Now Adam knew [yadah] Eve his wife, and she conceived" (Intimate knowledge)
    
- Jeremiah 31:34 — "They shall all know [yadah] me, from the least to the greatest"
    
- John 17:3 — "And this is eternal life, that they know [ginosko] you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ"
    
- Philippians 3:10 — "That I may know [ginosko] him and the power of his resurrection"
    
- 1 John 4:7 — "Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows [ginosko] God"
    

#### Narrative Context:

Used throughout the Old Testament to describe covenant relationship between God and His people. Applied by Jesus to describe the mutual knowledge between Himself and believers. Central to the New Covenant promise of universal, direct access to God.
