**Standard Meaning:** The Hebrew verb meaning "to save," "to deliver," or "to rescue." The root of the name "Yeshua" (Jesus).

**Hebraic Meaning:** Yasha means TO MAKE WIDE, TO CREATE SPACE, TO DELIVER FROM CONSTRICTION. It is the opposite of Tzar (narrowness/distress). When God "saves," He doesn't just remove you from danger—He brings you into a WIDE, SPACIOUS PLACE where you can breathe, move, and flourish. Yasha is liberation, expansion, the opening of possibilities that were previously closed.

**Paleo-Hebrew Linguistics:**

- **Yod (י)**: Hand, Arm—Work, Deed, Action
    
- **Shin (ש)**: Teeth—Consume, Sharp, Destroy
    
- **Ayin (ע)**: Eye—To see, Watch, Experience
    

**The Picture:**

The HAND (Yod) that DESTROYS (Shin) what prevents SIGHT (Ayin)—or, the work that removes the obstruction so you can see clearly. Yasha is the action of God's hand removing the enemy (Tzar) so that you can experience (see) life as it was meant to be.

**My Insight:** Yasha is the NAME ABOVE ALL NAMES because it is literally embedded in the name of Jesus—Yeshua. The name "Yeshua" means "YHWH saves" or "YHWH is salvation." Your framework shows that the NAME and the FUNCTION are inseparable: Jesus IS the Yasha of God made flesh. He entered the ultimate Tzar (the narrow place of crucifixion, the crushing weight of sin and judgment) to bring us into ultimate Yasha (wide, spacious, abundant life). Psalm 118:5 is the prophetic pattern: "Out of my distress [Tzar] I called on the LORD; the LORD answered me and set me in a broad place [Merchav—from the same root as Yasha]." Jesus LIVED this—He cried out from Tzar ("My God, why have you forsaken me?") and was answered by resurrection and ascension into Yasha (seated at God's right hand in the "broad place" of glory). When we are "saved," we are experiencing Yasha—not just forgiveness of sins, but SPACIOUSNESS OF LIFE. We are delivered from the constriction of sin, death, and fear into the wide-open freedom of sonship. This is why Paul can say "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom [eleutheria—Greek for spaciousness]" (2 Corinthians 3:17). Yasha is both the NAME (Yeshua) and the RESULT (salvation as spacious life).

**Scripture(s):**

- Psalm 118:5 — "Out of my distress I called on the LORD; the LORD answered me and set me in a broad place"
    
- Isaiah 12:2 — "Behold, God is my salvation [Yeshua]; I will trust, and will not be afraid"
    
- Matthew 1:21 — "You shall call his name Jesus [Yeshua], for he will save his people from their sins"
    
- Luke 2:30 — "For my eyes have seen your salvation [Yeshua]" (Simeon holding baby Jesus)
    
- Acts 4:12 — "And there is salvation [soteria—Greek for Yasha] in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven... by which we must be saved"
    

**Narrative Context:** Used throughout the Old Testament as God's characteristic action toward His people. Embodied in the name and person of Jesus. Central to the apostolic proclamation of the gospel.
