# YESH (יֵשׁ)

#### Standard Meaning:

A Hebrew word meaning "there is," "there exists," or "being/existence." Often translated as "substance" or "reality."

#### Hebraic Meaning:

Yesh is SUBSTANTIAL EXISTENCE, REAL BEING, ONTOLOGICAL WEIGHT. It is not just "existing" in a minimal sense, but BEING FILLED WITH REALITY AND SUBSTANCE. Yesh is what God possesses inherently - He is the ultimate Reality, the Source of all being. To have Yesh is to have REAL existence, permanence, and significance. It is the opposite of Havel (vapor/emptiness).

#### Paleo-Hebrew Linguistics:


- **Yod (י)**: Hand, Arm - Work, Deed, Action
    
- **Shin (ש)**: Teeth - Consume, Sharp, Destroy/Transform
    

#### The Picture:


The WORK/ACTION (Yod) that TRANSFORMS (Shin) nothing into something, chaos into order, emptiness into substance. Yesh is the result of God's creative activity - He MAKES things REAL, SUBSTANTIAL, PERMANENT.

#### My Insight:

Yesh is one of the three foundational pillars of the Seed theology (Yesh-HaShem-Kavod). This reveals that Hebrew biblical texts contain sophisticated abstract concepts that contradict scholarly assertions about ancient Hebrew lacking philosophical vocabulary. Yesh appears throughout Scripture, representing BEING, SUBSTANCE, EXISTENCE - refuting the claim that Hebrews couldn't think abstractly. The theological importance: God IS Yesh (pure, infinite, substantial being), and we RECEIVE Yesh by being "in Him." When we sin (Chata - twist away from Source), we lose our Yesh and become Havel (vapor). But the gospel is that Christ, who possesses infinite Yesh, shared His substance with us. We are "in Christ" (en Christo - Paul's phrase used 150+ times), which means we are held IN His Yesh, His being, His substance. This is why Acts 17:28 says "In him we live and move and have our being [Yesh]" - we exist because we are sustained by His existence. This demonstrates that salvation is not just legal (forgiveness of sins) but ONTOLOGICAL (restoration of being). We were Havel (empty), but in Christ we are given Yesh (substance). Faith is waking up to the Yesh we've always possessed in Him (Ephesians 1:4 - chosen in Him before the foundation). This connects to objective reconciliation: even before we "believe," we are held in His Yesh. Faith doesn't CREATE our Yesh - it RECOGNIZES the Yesh we already have in Christ.

#### Scripture(s):


- Proverbs 8:21 - "That I may cause those who love me to inherit Yesh [substance], and I will fill their treasuries" (Wisdom gives Yesh)
    
- Acts 17:28 - "For in him we live and move and have our being [Yesh]"
    
- Colossians 1:17 - "And he is before all things, and in him all things hold together" (Christ as the Yesh that sustains all reality)
    
- John 1:3-4 - "All things were made through him... In him was life [Yesh]"
    

#### Narrative Context:

Present throughout the Old Testament, particularly in Wisdom literature. Applied by Paul to describe union with Christ. Central to John's theology of Christ as the Logos (Word/Reason/Being) through whom all things exist.
