Jesus is the context of Scripture (Isa 53:4, 5).  Long before the first line of Scripture

was penned on papyrus scroll,

the Word, unwritten,

existed as the mind of God.

Before the books were gathered

collated as sacred text,

the Word, intangible; invisible,

was planning, was ordering

the ages that were to come.

This Word predates the Bible,

this Word predates creation,

this Word is alive and active

and speaking still today.
