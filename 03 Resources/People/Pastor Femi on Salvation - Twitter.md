# concerning salvation

1. [[ADAM|Adam]] was created as a spirit in the class of God

A spirit of dominion

A king in submission to the God king

Gen1:26

  

2 . He was created by God. God was his parent

He was alive to God

Awake to God

He functioned in perfection

  

3. Then by disobedience he fell

Lost his perfection

Died spiritually

Lost his consciousness of God's presence

  

4. As a fallen man he populated the world

With men in his new image

The image of the fallen man

Dead to God

Ruled by the senses

  

5. The whole world was now filled

With men and women in darkness

No light in their spirit.

A new order was necessary

  

6. Then we have Jesus

The spotless lamb of God

Sent to ransom Adam and all in him

From the demand of the divine legal system

  

7. You see Adam as an official of heaven committed

Treason against God's government

His punishment was death!

It was legal and divine

  

8. Adam was not redeemed from [[SATAN|Satan]]

Adam was redeemed from the demands of God's justice!

  

9 . so we have an obedient Christ paying for the sin of

the disobedient Adam.

It was an exchange

But the penalty was same

Death.

  

10. Just as all are condemned in Adam

All are free in Christ

No condemnation!

  

11 . Now Jesus redeemed all of man kind.

Every one has been redeemed!

Even the worst of us.

Whether they realise that or not.

However,

  

11 . All men are not saved.

All men are redeemed.

You may say what's the difference?

  

12. Redemption means to buy back by paying a

Price . its a legal term also an accounting term.

On the cross Jesus bought back all mankind

  

13. Salvation means deliverance, liberty

You see all men are redeemed

But all men are not saved

To be saved

A man has to believe

  

14. In Christ redemption to receive salvation.

He has to acknowledge the legal redemption to experience

Vital salvation

  

15. Jesus speaking in John 3:16

Whosoever believes on him shall not perish

But Have..

Jesus says there is a believing necessary

  

17. Paul says

With the heart man believes unto righteousness

With the mouth confession is made unto salvation rom 10:8-10

  

18. The man has to believe in the price paid for his redemption

And confess it to be saved

  

19. I will give you 10 witnesses on man believing unto salvation

You can study it.

  

18. Philip to the Ethiopia eunuch

Acts 8:37

If thou believe with all thine heart....

  

19. Peter says

Acts13:39

"By him all that believe are justified .........

  

20 . acts 15:11

But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they. (KJV)

  

21.rom 3:22

Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: (KJV)

  

22. But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; (KJV)rom4:24

  

23. The last verse says if we believe on him!

  

24. Jn 3:18

He that believe not is condemned already...

  

25. John3:36

He that believe not the son shall not see life!

  

26. 1john5:12

12 He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. (KJV)

  

27 I have given you 10 scriptures to show you

If you believe on Christ you have life

If you don't you are dead in your sins!

  

28 just has in Adam you have to be born into the fallen Kingdom

You became Adams son by birth

So it is with Christ.

  

29 a man needs to be born into the new race

That birth only happens by believing on him who died and rose again!

  

30 so where will those who reject Christ go to??

It's about justice.

The man who doesn't believe in Jesus will face the sentence of death

  

31. But you may say why punish him if his sins have been paid for?

Well his sin have been paid for in Christ

The Christ He hasn't believed

  

32 that man is saying I can face God's justice on my own merit.

I don't need Jesus.

It's his choice.

His free will

  

33.is hell real?? What a question!

As real as heaven.

Hell is a legal prison for the spiritually dead.

  

34. When a man dies his spirit gravitates towards

Either of two locations.

If the man has eternal life in him

Heaven pulls him in

  

35. If a man has not eternal life

Hell pulls him in.

Hello is a place for the spiritually dead

Heaven to the spiritually alive.

  

36. Heaven is for sons

Those who believed on Jesus and became Jesus incarnates

No slave of sin is allowed in!

  

37. We must preach the gospel of Jesus

So men can receive the faith of God to believe and become!

Become sons of righteousness

  

38. Believers

Preach and teach

For all redeemed must know and believe!

  

39 they must know that he paid for their sins

So they can receive his gift.

The gift is given not forced on us but given

To be received

  

40 if we don't receive the gift

He will not force himself on us.

God is a gentle man

  

41. A man believing makes him a son

He becomes alive to God He who was previously

Dead.

  

42. Blessed? ?

Bless God!
