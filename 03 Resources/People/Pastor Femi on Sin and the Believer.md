# Pastor Femi on Sin and the Believer

Let's look at sin and the Christian

@THCC_KMI @damilar3 @FolukeOlowu @Its_Tiwa @Debb_23 @phoenixafuye @shinobi_ennri

  

1. What is sin? Sin in the Greek means to

Miss the Mark.

We have before seen that it is a nature.

It's not just an act but a state

  

2. Now remember we are talking about sin and the Christian

Not just sin.

You see Jesus by his once and for all sacrifice

Dealt with sin

  

3.  For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified. (KJV)heb 10:14

The Christian is delivered from sin

  

4. The old man who was bound to sin died when Christ died

A new man rose when Christ rose

Rom6:6-14,

  

5 . The believer in his spirit is sin free

He cannot sin,  he has neither the capacity nor ability to commit

Sin 1jn3:9

  

6. What does it mean to commit Sin?

It means for it to come from you, initiated, conceived and executed by you.

  

7 . The spirit of the man born again doesn't have that capacity

He cannot conceive sin

He has been sealed by the holy ghost

  

8. So you may now say but I do sin?

Are you saying that my sin is not sin?

My wrong is not wrong??

Are you saying I can sin as a believer?

  

9. I am not saying that!

When a believer sins

It's because he permits a wrong act to be performed in his body.

He over rides his newself

  

10. You see though you are saved

Your spirit man is perfect.

Complete.

However, your soul and body isn't yet

  

11. Your soul needs saving James 1:20-21

Your body has to be disciplined 1cor9:27

But all these must be done through your spirit

  

12. Only your recreated spirit can renew your mind

And discipline your body . This is where many believers miss it!

  

13. You can't renew your mind by memorization of scriptures

Or new year resolutions

Or self effort.

  

14. You need to renew your mind by the word through your recreated

Spirit.

Your spirit Indwelt by God

Ought to instruct your mind

  

15. This is why you must develop the man

On the inside

Ensure he always has the advantage over your mind and body

  

16. How? ?

Meditating on God's word.

Think on it and say it to your self every time

As you do this

The word will gain the ascendancy

  

17. Your fleshly appetites will be tamed

Your spirit will be in control of your soul

And body.

Harmony.

  

18. So what happens when you sin?

Does God turn his back on you?

Does he stop talking?

Do you lose fellowship? Or relationship?

  

19. When a believer sins he doesn't break fellowship!

He feels bad, yes but he doesn't break fellowship.

What is fellowship?

  

20. Fellowship is from the Greek koinonia from the

Root koinos

It means to " share in common"

To partake or have in common

  

21. So to have fellowship with Christ means

To share in common with Christ

To have in common

To partake in common

  

22 . let's look at this

God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord. (KJV)1cor1:9

  

23. So we have been Called

In to a fellowship

A sharing in common

A partaking in common

With Christ Jesus

  

24 can sin take this away?

For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. (KJV)Rom 11:29

The calling to fellowship is unrevokable

  

25. We share in common his life

His love

His light

And nature!

We don't lose this.

Our fellowship with Christ is blood bought

  

26 .its an unbreakable fellowship

Sin doesn't break it!

For sin to break it is to make sin

More powerful than the blood

  

27 . so what happens to the Christian

When he sins?

The Holy spirit picks him up

And unveils Christ to him!

  

28. Shows him no judgement awaits him

No condemnation rom 8:1

Reminds him that sin has no power over him!rom 6:14

  

29. The spirit makes Christ finished work bigger

And magnified to him so he can know

The truth of who is

In Christ

Righteousness!

  

30. You see you will always be tempted to permit sin

In your physical body

As long as you are in this body

You will be tempted

  

31 however as you allow your recreated spirit greater

Influence you will find

That your body deaden to the impulses of sin

  

33 what you see

What goes on around you

That's why it's wisdom to guard

Entrance into your life

Your eyes, ears

  

34. Be more God inside conscious

Spend more time

Interacting with the man within

Spend more time!

There is power, character within!

  

35. You lack nothing

That addiction is nothing!

You are not bound

In your spirit you are free!

  

36. So don't live in sin

Sin is for slaves not sons

We are not slaves

We are sons

Sons of God!

We don't walk in sin

  

37. Remember to be carnality minded is death

To be spiritually minded is life and peace

If you permit sin In your body

  

38 you might be permitting death too.

Walking in the spirit is for your benefit!

  

39. So meditate on the word

Walk in the spirit

Life is sweeter

More exciting that way

  

40. Blessed?

Please share

Always remember

It's not over till you win!

  

Later we look at the fruits of fellowship!
