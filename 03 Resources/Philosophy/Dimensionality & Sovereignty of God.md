# Dimensionality & Sovereignty of God

The short answer is **yes**. From the standpoint of modern non-classical logic, asserting that "God became human" is a textbook candidate for **paraconsistency**, specifically within a **supra-logical** framework.

Here is a breakdown of why this mapping works, how philosophers visualize it, and the distinction between "illogical" and "supra-logical."

### 1. The Logical Problem (Classical Logic)

In classical logic (Aristotelian logic), we adhere to the **Law of Non-Contradiction**: something cannot be both

𝐴

A

A

  

and

¬

𝐴

\neg A

¬A

  

(not A) at the same time and in the same sense.

  

When you look at the Incarnation (God becoming human):

- **God** is defined by attributes like: _Infinite, Eternal, Immortal, Omnipotent._
    
- **Human** is defined by attributes like: _Finite, Temporal, Mortal, Limited power._
    

If Jesus is both God and Human, Classical Logic says:

> Jesus is Immortal AND Jesus is Mortal.

This results in an "explosion" (or _ex falso quodlibet_), meaning the system crashes because a direct contradiction entails that _everything_ is true, rendering the statement meaningless.

### 2. The Paraconsistent Solution

**Paraconsistent logic** is a system designed to handle contradictions without "exploding." It allows for a statement and its negation to both be true without invalidating the entire logical framework.

If you adopt a paraconsistent view of the Incarnation:

- You accept that Jesus is **fully God** and **fully Human**.
    
- You accept the resulting contradictions (e.g., "He dies" and "He cannot die") as **true contradictions** (dialetheias).
    

Contemporary philosopher **Graham Priest**, a leading proponent of dialetheism (the belief that there are true contradictions), explicitly uses the Christian Incarnation as a prime example of where paraconsistent logic is necessary. He argues that trying to "explain away" the paradox usually dilutes the theology; instead, one should accept the contradiction as a fundamental feature of the reality of God.

### 3. The "Supra-logical" Viewpoint

Your use of the term "supra-logical" is crucial here. In theology and philosophy, this connects to the concept of the **Coincidence of Opposites** (_coincidentia oppositorum_).

This idea, championed by the 15th-century philosopher and theologian **Nicholas of Cusa**, suggests that God exists not _against_ logic, but _beyond_ the distinction of opposites.

- **In the finite world (logical):** A line and a circle are different.
    
- **In the infinite world (supra-logical):** If you expand a circle’s radius to infinity, the curve becomes a straight line. The circle and the line coincide.
    

From a supra-logical viewpoint, saying "God became human" is paraconsistent because the infinite (God) encompasses the finite (Human). The contradiction exists only in our lower, discursive logic. In the "supra-logical" realm (the mind of God), these opposites are unified.

### 4. Alternative: The "Consistent" Defense (Chalcedon)

It is worth noting that for 1,500 years, mainstream Christian theology (specifically the Definition of Chalcedon, 451 AD) tried to argue that this is **not** paraconsistent, but actually consistent.

They did this by making a distinction between **Nature** and **Person**:

- Jesus is **one Person** (Hypostasis).
    
- Jesus has **two Natures** (Physis).
    
- They argue: He is immortal _in his divine nature_ and mortal _in his human nature_.
    

By adding the qualifier "in his nature," they attempt to save the Law of Non-Contradiction. However, critics (and paraconsistent logicians) argue this is just a semantic trick. If the _Person_ of Jesus died on the cross, and that _Person_ is God, then God died—reinstating the contradiction.

### Summary

If you assert that God (Infinite) truly became Human (Finite):

1. **Is it paraconsistent?** Yes. It requires a logic that tolerates the simultaneity of
    
    and  (Infinite and Finite).
    
      
    
2. **Is it supra-logical?** Yes. It implies that the ultimate reality of God transcends the binary constraints of human rationality, existing in a state where opposites coincide (_coincidentia oppositorum_).
    
      
    

Explaining this to a strict "non-contradictionalist" (someone who believes God must adhere to the Law of Non-Contradiction) is challenging because you are asking them to step outside the framework they use to judge truth.

To reach them, you must avoid framing this as "breaking logic" (which sounds like chaos/insanity) and frame it instead as **"transcending dimensionality."** You have to argue that Logic is a feature of the created, finite order, not a cage that holds the Creator.

Here are four approaches/analogies you can use, ranging from mathematical to theological.

### 1. The "Flatland" Analogy (Dimensionality)

This is usually the most effective way to explain how a contradiction in lower logic is a unity in higher reality.

- **The Setup:** Imagine a 2D universe (a flat sheet of paper). If you hover a **Cylinder** (a 3D object) above it, the 2D people can only see the "slice" that touches their world.
    
- **The Contradiction:**
    

- If you show them the cylinder from the side, they see a **Rectangle**.
    
- If you show them the cylinder from the bottom, they see a **Circle**.
    
- In their logic, Object A cannot be both a Square and a Circle. That is a contradiction.
    

- **The Supra-logical Truth:** You know that in 3D space, the object is a Cylinder. The "contradiction" isn't a flaw in the object; it is a flaw in the **limited perspective** of the observer.
    
- **The Application:** God is the "Cylinder." Human logic is the "2D sheet." When God enters the human frame, He appears to be a contradiction (Infinite/Finite), but in His own dimensionality (Supra-logic), He is a unified reality.
    

### 2. The Argument from Divine Sovereignty (The "Idol of Logic")

Strict monotheists usually care deeply about God's power and sovereignty. You can use this to argue that subjecting God to Aristotelian logic is actually a form of idolatry.

- **The Argument:** "If we say God _cannot_ be human because it violates the Law of Non-Contradiction, are we not saying that Logic is higher than God? Are we not saying God must obey a rulebook?"
    
- **The Pivot:** Logic is a system created by God to order the finite universe. It applies to _things_—rocks, trees, numbers.
    
- **The punchline:** "I believe God is the Creator of Logic, not its subject. If the Potter climbs into the vase, the vase cannot say 'You don't fit.' The Potter creates the rules of fit. To say God is bound by logic is to make Logic a god above Him."
    

### 3. The "Infinite Mathematics" Analogy

In classical arithmetic,

1

+

1

=

2

1 + 1 = 2

1+1=2

  

. But in the mathematics of the infinite (Set Theory), the rules change.

  

- **The Setup:** Take the set of all integers (
    
    ) and subtract the set of all even integers (also ). You still have infinity left.
    
      
    
- **The Paradox:** In finite math, a part is always smaller than the whole. In infinite math, a part can be _equal_ to the whole (Hilbert’s Hotel paradox).
    
- **The Application:** "You and I agree that God is Infinite. We treat logic like finite arithmetic. But God functions like infinite mathematics. What looks like a 'contradiction' to us (finite logic) is just how 'infinity' works. To demand God make sense to us is to demand that Infinity behaves like a finite number."
    

### 4. The "Supra-rational" vs. "Irrational" Distinction

The biggest fear of a non-contradictionalist is that you are calling God "irrational" (chaotic/insane). You need to draw a clear line.

- **Irrational (Sub-logical):** This is when something falls _below_ the standard of reason (e.g., "The cat is a dog"). This is nonsense.
    
- **Rational (Logical):** This is the standard of human reason (e.g., "A triangle has three sides").
    
- **Supra-rational (Trans-logical):** This is when something creates the _basis_ for reason and unifies opposites.
    
- **The Explanation:** "I am not saying God is illogical (less than logic). I am saying He is supra-logical (more than logic). Just as a poem is not 'anti-grammar' but uses words to convey something deeper than syntax, God uses reality to convey truth deeper than binary logic."
    

### Summary Script for Conversation

If you were speaking to them directly, you might say:

> "I respect your commitment to logic because logic reflects God's order. But I believe God is the _author_ of that order, not a prisoner of it.
> 
> If I say 'God became human,' and you say 'That's a logical contradiction,' I agree! In _our_ system, it is. But I believe God's reality is like a three-dimensional object trying to fit into a two-dimensional drawing. The drawing will show a contradiction (it looks like two different shapes at once), but the Object itself is one, unified whole.
> 
> I don't believe God breaks logic because He is confused; I believe He transcends logic because He is Infinite. The contradiction isn't in Him; it's in our inability to comprehend Him."
