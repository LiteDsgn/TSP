This is a profound question that takes you to the absolute edge of theology and logic.

The short answer is: **Yes, absolutely.**

From a **paraconsistent** standpoint, the statement "God exists and God does not exist" is a valid dialetheia (a true contradiction).

From a **supra-logical** standpoint, this touches on what is known as **Apophatic Theology** (Negative Theology) and the concept of the "God beyond God."

Here is how you can frame this specific contradiction, distinguishing it from simple atheism.

### 1. The Trap of "Existence"

In standard logic and language, when we say "X exists," we are putting X into the category of "things that are real," alongside toasters, planets, and atoms.

If God is truly the **Creator** of all things, He cannot be just another "thing" inside the bucket of existence. He is the _source_ of the bucket.

- Therefore, to say "God exists" (like a toaster exists) is technically false.
    
- But to say "God does not exist" (like a unicorn) is also false.
    

**The Paraconsistent Conclusion:** You must say **"God exists and does not exist."**

- _He exists_ because He is the Real.
    
- _He does not exist_ because He is not a "being" in the way we understand beings.
    

### 2. The Theological Precedent (Christian Mysticism)

You are in good company with this thought. Some of the greatest monotheistic thinkers have held this supra-logical view:

- **Pseudo-Dionysius (5th Century):** He argued that God is "Hyper-ousios" (Supra-being). He stated that God is beyond both assertion and denial. We cannot strictly say God "is," nor can we say God "is not." He transcends the binary of Being and Non-Being.
    
- **Meister Eckhart (13th Century):** He distinguished between **God** (the Revealed Creator, the Trinity) and the **Godhead** (_Deitas_). The Godhead is the absolute, undifferentiated ground of reality, which he famously called "The Desert" or "The Nothing." To reach the ultimate reality, one must penetrate beyond "God" to the "Godhead."
    
- **Paul Tillich (20th Century):** A modern theologian who argued that "God does not exist. He is Being-itself." Tillich argued that to say "God exists" is actually to deny Him, because it limits Him to being a finite object.
    

### 3. How this is Supra-logical (The Coincidence of Being and Nothingness)

In classical logic: Being and Nothing are mutually [exclusive.In](https://exclusive.In) supra-logic (Hegel or Eastern Orthodoxy): Pure Being and Pure Nothingness are indistinguishable at the absolute limit.

If God is Infinite, He has no boundaries. If He has no boundaries, He has no definition (definitio means "to set limits"). If He has no definition, He appears to the logical mind as "Nothing."

- **Light Analogy:** If you stare at a light that is infinitely bright, you go blind. The result is darkness.
    

- Infinite Light = Darkness (to the human eye).
    
- Infinite Being = Non-Being (to the human mind).
    

### 4. Caution: Explaining this to the "Non-Contradictionalist"

While you can argue the "Incarnation" (God/Man) to a traditional monotheist using the "Flatland" analogy, explaining "God/No God" is much harder.

To a strict traditionalist, "There is no God" sounds like **Atheism**.

If you share this view with them, you must clarify that you are not speaking of **privation** (the lack of God), but of **transcendence** (a God too big for the word "existence").

**The phrasing that bridges the gap:**Instead of saying "There is God and no God," tell them:

> "God is so real that He transcends the concept of existence. He does not just 'exist' alongside the universe; He is the underlying reality that allows existence to happen. So, strictly speaking, He is not a 'being'—He is the Power of Being itself."

### Summary

Yes, asserting "God and No God" is the ultimate paraconsistent statement. It implies that the Ultimate Reality is the **ground** of the binary opposites "True/False" and "Exist/Not-Exist," and therefore resides in both and neither simultaneously. This is the realm of high mysticism.
