This is the most common "gotcha" verse used by Unitarians, Jehovah's Witnesses, and Muslims. They believe John 14:28 ("The Father is greater than I") is the smoking gun that proves Jesus is created and inferior.

However, this argument relies on a category error: **confusing "Role" with "Nature."**

Here is how you rebut this logically, historically, and scripturally.

### 1. The Logic: "Greater" does not mean "Better Nature"

In English (and Greek), the word "greater" (_meizon_) usually refers to **position, rank, or authority**, not essential nature or biology.

**The Analogy:**Imagine the President of your country and a regular citizen.

- Is the President **"greater"** than the citizen? **Yes.** He has more authority, a higher rank, and commands the military.
    
- Is the President **"more human"** than the citizen? **No.** They share the exact same human nature. They are equal in _essence_ but different in _rank_.
    

**The Application:**When Jesus says, "The Father is greater than I," He is speaking about His **position** during His time on earth, not His **nature** as God.

- Jesus was sent (Agent).
    
- The Father sent Him (Sender).
    
- The Sender is always "greater" in rank than the Sent, even if they are equal in essence.
    

**What to say:**

> "You are confusing **who** someone is with **what rank** they hold. The President is greater than me in authority, but he is not 'more human' than me. We are equal in nature.
> 
> In the Trinity, the Father and Son are equal in nature (both God), but distinct in role. The Father sends, and the Son obeys. Submitting to authority doesn't make you less divine; it just makes you a faithful Son."

### 2. The Scriptural Context: The Incarnation (Philippians 2)

You must remind them _where_ Jesus is when He says this. He is on earth, wearing human flesh, walking toward the cross. He is not speaking from the Throne of Heaven at that moment; He is speaking from the dust of the earth.

**The Scripture:**

- **Philippians 2:6-7:** "[Jesus], being in very nature God... **made himself nothing** by taking the very nature of a servant."
    
- **Hebrews 2:9:** "Jesus... was made **a little lower than the angels**."
    

**The Argument:**If Jesus was made "lower than the angels" for a time, then of course the Father was "greater" than Him during his earthly life! Jesus had voluntarily restricted His glory to become a man.

**What to say:**

> "When Jesus said this, He had voluntarily 'emptied Himself' to become a human servant (Philippians 2). He had set aside His glory to be born as a man.
> 
> As a man, listening to God and obeying the Law, the Father _was_ greater than Him. If Jesus had said, 'I am just as great as the Father' while He was a mortal man on earth, He would have been denying His role as a servant. He is speaking about His temporary humiliation, not His eternal nature."

### 3. The "Hostile Witness" Strategy: Using John against them

The opponents are quoting **John 14:28**. They are using the Gospel of John as their authority. You need to show them that **John**—the very author they are quoting—explicitly defines Jesus as God equal to the Father.

If John wrote verse 14:28 to prove Jesus _wasn't_ God, why did he write these other verses?

- **John 1:1:** "The Word was God."
    
- **John 5:18:** "He was even calling God his own Father, **making himself equal with God.**"
    

- _Note:_ The Jews understood that calling God your "Father" in a unique sense was a claim to equality of nature.
    

- **John 10:30:** "I and the Father are one."
    
- **John 20:28:** Thomas calls Jesus, "My Lord and my God." Jesus accepts it.
    

**What to say:**

> "You are quoting John 14:28 to prove Jesus isn't God. But the Apostle John, who wrote that verse, starts his book by saying 'The Word was God' (John 1:1) and ends it with Thomas calling Jesus 'My God' (John 20:28).
> 
> Do you think John was confused? Or is it possible that John understood that Jesus could be **equal to God in nature** (John 5:18) while being **subordinate to the Father in role** (John 14:28)? You have to accept the whole Gospel of John, not just the verse that sounds like it supports your view."

### 4. The Historical Context: The Athanasian Distinction

Historically, the Church Fathers (like Athanasius and Augustine) answered this objection 1,600 years ago using the doctrine of the **Hypostatic Union** (Jesus has two natures).

- **According to His Deity:** "I and the Father are one." (Equality)
    
- **According to His Humanity:** "The Father is greater than I." (Subordination)
    

Jesus is one person with two natures. Sometimes He speaks from His divinity ("Before Abraham was, I AM"), and sometimes He speaks from His humanity ("I thirst," "I do not know the hour," "The Father is greater").

**What to say:**

> "Jesus is fully God and fully man. When He says 'The Father is greater,' He is speaking as the Human Messiah who submits to God. When He says 'I and the Father are one,' He is speaking as the Eternal Son.
> 
> If you deny this, you have to explain how a mere human prophet could say 'Before Abraham was, I AM' (John 8:58) without being a lunatic."

### Summary Rebuttal

When they quote "The Father is greater than I," your response is:

1. **Logic:** "Greater" refers to **rank**, not **biology/essence**. A General is greater than a Soldier, but they are both equally human.
    
2. **Context:** Jesus was on earth as a servant (Philippians 2). Of course the King in Heaven is greater than the Servant on Earth. That doesn't mean the Servant isn't part of the Royal Family.
    
3. **Author Intent:** The author (John) also wrote "The Word was God" and "Making himself equal with God." John clearly believed Jesus was God, so you are misinterpreting John's own words.
