# That's just Hellenistic High Christology

This is a classic pivot. When you corner them on the text of Revelation or John, they try to dismiss those books as "corrupted by Greek philosophy" (Hellenism) or "inventions of Paul."

Here is how you handle the "Hellenistic/Pauline Corruption" argument, followed by the unpacking of the historical evidence for early Jewish worship of Jesus.

### Part 1: How to Answer "That's just Hellenistic High Christology"

If they reject John and Paul, you must go to the sources they generally accept: **Mark** (the earliest Gospel) and the **Old Testament context** (which is Jewish, not Greek).

The argument that "Jesus became God later due to Greek influence" fails because the most "divine" claims Jesus makes are rooted in **Daniel (Jewish prophecy)**, not Plato (Greek philosophy).

**1. The "Son of Man" Argument (Mark 14:62)**In Mark (which they usually accept as the "historical" Gospel), the High Priest asks Jesus if He is the Messiah.

- **Jesus says:** _"I am. And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."_
    
- **The Context:** This is a direct quote from **Daniel 7:13-14**. In Daniel, the "Son of Man" is a figure who rides the clouds (something only Yahweh does in the OT) and is given "authority, glory and sovereign power" so that **"all nations and peoples of every language worshiped him."**
    
- **The Point:** Jesus claimed to be the figure in Daniel who receives eternal worship. That is a Jewish claim to deity, not a Greek one.
    

**2. The "Lord of the Sabbath" (Mark 2:28)**

- In Jewish theology, the Sabbath is God's institution. Only God has authority over it.
    
- When Jesus claims to be "Lord even of the Sabbath," He is putting himself above the Law of Moses. To a first-century Jew, that is a claim to be the Lawgiver (God).
    

**Response to them:**

> "You say John and Paul invented this under Greek influence. But in the Gospel of Mark, Jesus claims to be the 'Son of Man' from Daniel 7—a figure who rides the clouds and receives worship from all nations. That is purely Jewish theology, not Greek. Why did the High Priest accuse him of blasphemy in Mark 14 if he was just a humble teacher?"

### Part 2: Unpacking "Early Jewish Worship of Jesus"

You asked if it is **real** that thousands of strict monotheistic Jews worshiped Jesus immediately after his death.**Yes, it is historically real.** This is currently the dominant view in New Testament scholarship (championed by scholars like **Larry Hurtado** and **Richard Bauckham**).

Here is the evidence you can use. It relies on things that pre-date the writing of the New Testament.

#### 1. The "Maranatha" Evidence (Linguistic Archaeology)

In 1 Corinthians 16:22, Paul writes the phrase _"Maranatha."_

- **What it means:** It is an Aramaic phrase meaning **"Our Lord, come!"**
    
- **Why it matters:**
    

- **Aramaic** was the language of the earliest Jewish Christians in Judea/Jerusalem, _not_ the Greek Christians in Ephesus or Rome.
    
- If the idea of Jesus as "Lord" was invented later by Greeks, the prayer would be in Greek (_Kurios_).
    
- The fact that Paul (writing in Greek to Greeks) preserves an **Aramaic** prayer formula proves that the _very first_ Jewish followers—before Paul even started writing—were already praying to Jesus as "Lord" and invoking His presence.
    
- **Conclusion:** You don't pray to a dead prophet to "come." You pray to God. Jewish Christians were praying to Jesus in their native tongue within years of the resurrection.
    

#### 2. The Pre-Pauline Creeds (1 Corinthians 15 & Philippians 2)

Paul wrote his letters around 50–60 AD. However, in his letters, he quotes "creeds" or "hymns" that he says he **received** from those who came before him. Scholars date these creeds to within **3–5 years** of the crucifixion.

- **Philippians 2:6-11 (The Carmen Christi):** This is an early hymn Paul quotes. It says Jesus was _"in very nature God"_ but humbled himself, and now every knee bows to Him.
    

- **The Kicker:** The phrase "Every knee bow, every tongue confess" is a direct quote from **Isaiah 45:23**, where Yahweh says, "To **Me** every knee shall bow."
    
- The earliest Jewish Christians were singing a song that applied Yahweh's exclusive rights to Jesus.
    

#### 3. The "Social Mutation" Argument

This is the strongest historical argument. First-century Jews were **strict monotheists**. They had a "bipolar" view of reality: There is God (Creator), and there is everything else (Created). They did not worship angels or intermediaries. They died rather than bow to Caesar.

Yet, immediately after 33 AD, we see thousands of Jews:

- Praying _to_ Jesus.
    
- Baptizing _in the name_ of Jesus.
    
- Celebrating the "Lord’s Supper" (a sacred ritual centered on Jesus).
    
- Calling Jesus "Lord" (_Kyrios_), the Greek translation of YHWH.
    

**The Argument to use:**

> "History doesn't evolve that fast without an explosion. You are suggesting that thousands of Jews, who would die rather than worship an idol, suddenly started worshiping a crucified carpenter as God—and they did it while his brother James and his best friend Peter were still leading the church.
> 
> If Peter and James believed Jesus was just a 'servant,' they would have stopped this 'blasphemy' immediately. Instead, they led it. The only historical explanation is that the resurrection actually happened, convincing them that Jesus shared the identity of the One God."

### Summary for your discussion

If they pivot to "Jesus was a servant" or "High Christology is Greek," you hit them with:

1. **Mark's Gospel:** Jesus claims the Divine Cloud-Rider title from Daniel (Jewish, not Greek).
    
2. **Maranatha:** The earliest prayer to Jesus is in Aramaic, proving it started in Jerusalem, not Greece.
    
3. **The Creeds:** Christians were singing about Jesus as God (Philippians 2) before the New Testament was even written.
