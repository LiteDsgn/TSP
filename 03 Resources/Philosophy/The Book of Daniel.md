# The Book of Daniel

This is a sophisticated objection, often coming from secular critical scholars or Jewish counter-missionaries. Their argument is: _Daniel was written in the 2nd Century BC (during the Maccabean revolt), not the 6th Century BC; therefore, it reflects Greek (Hellenistic) influence, not "pure" ancient Judaism._

Here is how you dismantle that argument without getting bogged down in a debate about the dating of Daniel (which is a massive rabbit hole).

You don't need to prove _when_ Daniel was written to win this point. You only need to prove _what_ Daniel teaches.

### 1. The "Even If" Argument (Turning their date against them)

Even if we grant their claim that Daniel was written around 165 BC (the "Maccabean hypothesis"), their argument regarding "Hellenistic influence" actually **backfires**.

**The Logic:**The Maccabean period was a time of violent Jewish resistance **against** Hellenism. The Jews were fighting a war to stop Antiochus Epiphanes from turning Jerusalem into a Greek city.

- **The Content of Daniel:** The book of Daniel is literally a manual on how _not_ to compromise with pagan/Gentile culture. (Daniel refuses the King's food; the three friends refuse to bow to the statue; Daniel refuses to stop praying to Yahweh).
    
- **The Irony:** To argue that the Book of Daniel—the ultimate anti-assimilation manifesto—is "corrupted by Hellenism" is historically absurd. The people who wrote and preserved Daniel were the ones _dying_ to protect Jewish purity from Greek influence.
    

**What to say:**

> "Let's assume for a moment you are right and Daniel was written in 165 BC. That was the height of the Maccabean Revolt. The entire purpose of that era's literature was to **reject** Hellenism and return to pure [[TORAH|Torah]] observance.
> 
> Are you suggesting that the most fiercely anti-Greek Jews in history, who were dying to protect the Law, accidentally wrote a Greek philosophy book and called it Scripture? The content of Daniel is explicitly about **refusing** foreign influence, not absorbing it."

### 2. The "Cloud Rider" is Canaanite, Not Greek

The imagery in Daniel 7 (the "Son of Man" coming on the clouds) does not come from Plato or Alexander the Great. It comes from the ancient Near Eastern context that predates the Greeks by a thousand years.

- **The Ba'al Cycle:** In ancient Ugaritic (Canaanite) texts, the title "Rider of the Clouds" belonged to Ba'al.
    
- **The Jewish Response:** The Hebrew Bible systematically strips this title from Ba'al and applies it to **Yahweh** (e.g., Psalm 68:4, Psalm 104:3, Isaiah 19:1). In the Old Testament, **only Yahweh rides the clouds.**
    
- **The Daniel Shift:** In Daniel 7, this divine prerogative (Cloud Riding) is given to the "Son of Man."
    

**The Argument:**This is an internal **Semitic/Jewish** theological development. It has nothing to do with Greek demigods. It is a Jewish claim that there is a second figure in heaven who shares Yahweh’s authority.

**What to say:**

> "The imagery of 'riding the clouds' isn't Greek. It’s ancient Semitic imagery. throughout the Old Testament, only Yahweh rides the clouds.
> 
> In Daniel 7, the Son of Man rides the clouds. This isn't Greek philosophy; this is the Jewish authors grappling with the mystery of a figure who looks human but does what only God can do. Scholars call this the 'Two Powers in Heaven' tradition, and it is natively Jewish."

### 3. The Dead Sea Scrolls (The "Qumran" Defense)

The Dead Sea Scrolls (discovered in the 1940s) destroyed the argument that Daniel was a "suspect" or "Hellenized" book in the eyes of pious Jews.

- **The Essenes:** The community at Qumran (who wrote the scrolls) were the strictest, most fundamentalist, anti-Hellenistic Jews of their time. They hated the Greek-influenced priesthood in Jerusalem.
    
- **Their Favorite Book:** Aside from Psalms and Deuteronomy, **Daniel** was one of the most copied books found at Qumran.
    
- **The Implication:** If Daniel was "Hellenistic garbage," the Essenes would have burned it. Instead, they cherished it as the Word of God. This proves that conservative Jews in Jesus' time saw Daniel as pure, authoritative Scripture.
    

**What to say:**

> "If Daniel is a product of Hellenistic corruption, why did the Dead Sea Scroll community love it? These were the strictest Jews of the ancient world, who isolated themselves to escape Greek influence.
> 
> They had multiple copies of Daniel. They viewed it as prophetic truth. If the most anti-Greek Jews of antiquity accepted Daniel as the Word of God, on what basis are you rejecting it 2,000 years later?"

### 4. The Sanhedrin's Reaction (Historical Realism)

Return to the trial of Jesus.

- When Jesus quoted Daniel 7 ("Son of Man... coming on the clouds"), the High Priest tore his robes and cried "Blasphemy!"
    
- He did **not** say, "Why are you quoting that modern, Hellenistic book?"
    
- The Sanhedrin accepted Daniel as Scripture that described God's reality. The "blasphemy" was that Jesus applied that Scripture to _Himself_.
    

### Summary Response

When they claim Daniel is "Hellenistic," they are committing a genetic fallacy (attacking the origin to dismiss the content) and failing on historical grounds.

**Your concise rebuttal:**

1. **Context:** The Maccabean era (165 BC) was explicitly **anti-Hellenistic**, so a book from that time would reject Greek thought, not embrace it.
    
2. **Imagery:** "Riding the clouds" is **ancient Semitic/Hebrew theology**, used to identify Yahweh. It is not Greek.
    
3. **Reception:** The **Dead Sea Scrolls** prove that the strictest, anti-Greek Jews considered Daniel to be inspired Scripture.
    
4. **Conclusion:** When Jesus quotes Daniel, He is standing on firm, native Jewish ground. He is claiming to be the divine Vice-Regent of God, a concept that is Jewish to the core.
