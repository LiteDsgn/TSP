Here are 5 paraconsistent analogies tailored to the Nigerian context. These are designed to be "proof-resistant"—meaning that while they contain a contradiction, the contradiction is arguably necessary for the system to work, making it hard for a critic to dismantle them without destroying the reality they describe.

### 1. The Egungun (Masquerade) Analogy

**Target:** The Incarnation (God becoming Man).

- **The Scenario:** In traditional Nigerian culture, when the _Egungun_ comes out, we face a paradox.
    

- **Fact A (Scientific/Human):** We know there is a human being inside the costume. It is Uncle Tunde. He has flesh, blood, and needs to drink water.
    
- **Fact B (Spiritual/Cultural):** We know that once the rites are performed, he is _no longer_ Uncle Tunde; he is the Spirit of the Ancestor. He is divine.
    

- **The Paraconsistent Logic:** If you ask the Chief, "Is this a man or a spirit?" The answer is "Yes."
    

- To say it is _just_ a man is to insult the tradition (Atheism).
    
- To say it is _just_ a spirit is to deny the sweat on his brow (Docetism).
    
- **The Supra-logical Truth:** The reality of the Masquerade _depends_ on the coincidence of the two. The Finite (Man) becomes the vehicle for the Infinite (Spirit).
    

- **The Defense (Hole-Poking):** If the critic says, "But logically, he can't be both," you reply: _"In the logic of biology, he is one. In the logic of the ritual, he is the other. In the reality of the festival, he is the union of both. Are you saying the festival isn't real?"_
    

### 2. The Chinua Achebe Analogy (The Author & The Character)

**Target:** God’s Sovereignty vs. Human Action (and the "Death of God").

- **The Scenario:** Imagine Chinua Achebe writing _Things Fall Apart_. He creates Okonkwo.
    

- **The Contradiction:** Achebe is in every line of Okonkwo’s dialogue (Okonkwo _is_ Achebe's mind). Yet, Achebe is _not_ Okonkwo (Achebe lives in the US; Okonkwo lives in Umuofia).
    

- **The "God Died" Paradox:** If Achebe decides to write himself into the book as a character, and the villagers kill that character...
    

- **Did the Author die?** Yes (in the story).
    
- **Did the Author die?** No (in his study).
    

- **The Defense (Hole-Poking):** The critic says, "God cannot die." You reply: _"Did Achebe cease to be the author when he wrote a death scene? No. The death happened inside the story he sustains. God (The Author) entered History (The Book). The character died, but the Author sustains the existence of the book even while dying in it."_
    

### 3. The "Lagos Map" Analogy

**Target:** The difference between Logical Truth and Supra-logical Truth.

- **The Scenario:** You have a Google Map of Lagos on your phone, and you have the _actual_ Lagos.
    
- **The Logic:**
    

- The Map (Logic) is flat, small, and static.
    
- The City (God) is chaotic, 3D, and moving.
    

- **The Contradiction:** On the map, the distance from Ikeja to VI is "20 minutes" (Pure Math). In reality, it is "2 hours" (Traffic/Chaos).
    

- If you scream at the traffic, "But the map says 20 minutes!" you are the one who is crazy, not the traffic.
    

- **The Defense (Hole-Poking):** The critic says, "God must follow logic (The Map)." You reply: _"The Map is just a drawing we made to understand the City. The City does not obey the Map; the Map tries to describe the City. When the Map contradicts the road, you trust the road. When Logic contradicts God, I trust God."_
    

### 4. The "Bank Alert" Analogy (Virtual Presence)

**Target:** "God and No God" (Existence vs. Transcendence).

- **The Scenario:** You do a transfer to someone. They receive a "Bank Alert."
    
- **The Question:** Where is the money?
    

- Is the money in your phone? No.
    
- Is the money in the bank vault? Physically, probably not (it's just numbers).
    
- Does the money exist? Yes.
    

- **The Paraconsistent View:** The money possesses a _virtual reality_. It is "Nothing" (just data, no atoms), yet it is "Everything" (it can buy a house).
    
- **The Defense (Hole-Poking):** If the critic says, "God must either exist physically or not exist at all," you reply: _"Even your money doesn't follow those rules! Your wealth exists in a 'cloud' that is nowhere and everywhere. If a Zenith Bank server is 'supra-physical,' why can't God be 'supra-existential'?"_
    

### 5. The "Sleeping Father" Analogy (Power dynamics)

**Target:** The weakness of God (The Cross/Humanity).

- **The Scenario:** A powerful Nigerian military general comes home. His 2-year-old daughter wants to play "horse." The General gets on his hands and knees and lets her ride him.
    
- **The Contradiction:**
    

- **State A:** He is the Strongest Man in the country (General).
    
- **State B:** He is the Weakest Man in the room (Subservient to a toddler).
    

- **The Supra-logical Truth:** He is _only_ able to be that weak because he is so strong. A weak man would be insecure and refuse to bow. The General’s power allows him to assume the position of powerlessness without losing his essence.
    
- **The Defense (Hole-Poking):** The critic says, "It is undignified for God to become a crying baby or a bleeding man." You reply: _"It is only undignified if He is forced to do it. If He chooses it, it is the ultimate flex. His capacity to become 'Non-God' (human/weak) is the ultimate proof that He is God. His power is so absolute it includes the power to be powerless."_
