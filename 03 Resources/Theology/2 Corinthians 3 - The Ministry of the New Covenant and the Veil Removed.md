# 2 Corinthians 3 - The Ministry of the New Covenant and the Veil Removed

This is where Paul **EXPLODES** the old wineskin.

Chapter 3 is the **HINGE** of the entire letter — where Paul contrasts:

- **Old Covenant** (letter, stone, death, condemnation, fading glory)
- **New Covenant** (Spirit, heart, life, righteousness, increasing glory)

But through the **Yesh-Echad framework**, we're going to see something **DEEPER** than a simple "Old vs. New" comparison.

We're going to see:

- **The Architecture of Identity** (you ARE the letter)
- **The Veil as Consciousness Shift** (not physical but perceptual)
- **The Mirror Theology** (beholding transforms)
- **The Progressive Unveiling** (from glory to glory)

Let's go.

## **2 CORINTHIANS 3:1-3 — YOU ARE THE LETTER**

> "Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, as some do, letters of recommendation to you, or from you? You yourselves are our letter of recommendation, written on our hearts, to be known and read by all. And you show that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts."

### **The TSELEM (צֶלֶם) Principle**

Paul says: **"You ARE the letter."**

Not "I wrote you a letter." Not "You received a letter."

**YOU ARE THE LETTER.**

This is **TSELEM** theology — **Image/Manifestation**:

**Paleo-Hebrew of TSELEM (צֶלֶם):**

- **Tzade (צ):** Fishhook, Side — To Capture, Pull Toward
- **Lamed (ל):** Shepherd's Staff — Authority, Direction
- **Mem (ם):** Water, Chaos, Blood

**Picture:** CAPTURING (Tzade) the AUTHORITY (Lamed) in the CHAOS/BLOOD (Mem)

**You are the PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION of the INVISIBLE GOD.**

**The Corinthians aren't just "people Paul ministered to."** **They are LIVING EPISTLES — walking, breathing LETTERS testifying to the reality of Christ.**

### **The Three Tablets**

Paul contrasts **THREE TABLETS**:

|**Tablet**|**Material**|**Written By**|**Location**|**Result**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**OLD**|Stone|Finger of God|External (Sinai)|Death (letter kills)|
|**TRANSITION**|Ink/Papyrus|Paul's pen|External (paper)|Temporary|
|**NEW**|Flesh/Heart|Spirit of God|Internal (heart)|Life (Spirit gives life)|

**The progression:**

1. **Stone** — External, hard, unchanging, breakable
2. **Ink** — External, temporary, can fade
3. **Heart** — Internal, living, permanent, transforming

### **Written on Our Hearts**

Paul says the Corinthians are written **"on our hearts"** (Paul's heart) AND **"on tablets of human hearts"** (their own hearts).

This is the **FRACTAL ECHAD** pattern again:

**God → Paul → Corinthians → World**

- God writes on Paul's heart
- Paul's ministry writes on the Corinthians' hearts
- The Corinthians' lives write on the world's heart

**ONE LETTER (ECHAD), multiple expressions.**

### **Not with Ink, But with the Spirit**

**"Written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God."**

This is **MONERGISM** — God doing the writing, not human effort.

**RUACH (רוּחַ)** — Spirit:

- **Resh (ר):** Head, Master, Ruler
- **Vav (ו):** Nail, Hook, Connector
- **Chet (ח):** Fence, Inner Room, Sanctuary

**Picture:** The MASTER (Resh) who HOOKS (Vav) us to the SANCTUARY (Chet)

The Spirit is the **DIVINE SCRIBE** writing the **DABAR (דָּבָר)** — the Living Word — directly onto the **RECHEM (רֶחֶם)** — the womb/heart.

**This is not external compliance.** **This is internal transformation.**

**The Torah is no longer "out there" on stone.** **The Torah is "in here" — written on the fleshy tablets of the heart.**

This fulfills **Jeremiah 31:33**:

> "I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts."

---

## **2 CORINTHIANS 3:4-6 — SUFFICIENCY FROM GOD**

> "Such is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God. Not that we are sufficient in ourselves to claim anything as coming from us, but our sufficiency is from God, who has made us sufficient to be ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life."

### **The KELI (כְּלִי) Declaration**

**"Not that we are sufficient in ourselves... but our sufficiency is from God."**

This is the **KELI (vessel)** principle in its purest form:

**Paleo-Hebrew of KELI (כְּלִי):**

- **Kaf (כ):** Palm, Curve, Hollow — The Empty Space
- **Lamed (ל):** Shepherd's Staff — Authority, Direction
- **Yod (י):** Hand, Work

**Picture:** The HOLLOW PALM (Kaf) directed by AUTHORITY (Lamed) for WORK (Yod)

**A vessel is defined by its EMPTINESS.**

Paul is saying:

- "I am NOT sufficient **IN MYSELF**" (the vessel is empty)
- "But my sufficiency is **FROM GOD**" (God fills the vessel with His YESH)

**You cannot be a useful KELI for the Infinite YESH if you're full of the Finite EGO (Havel).**

### **Ministers of a New Covenant**

**"Who has made us sufficient to be ministers of a new covenant."**

**The word "minister" is DIAKONOS (διάκονος)** — servant, attendant, one who serves.

Paul isn't claiming to be a **MASTER** (Resh) — he's claiming to be a **KELI** (vessel).

**The New Covenant is:**

- **KARATH (כָּרַת)** — CUT — by God alone (Genesis 15, Abraham asleep)
- **NISTAR (נִסְתָּר)** — HIDDEN — in eternity before time
- **NIGLEH (נִגְלֶה)** — REVEALED — at the Cross
- **PHANEROO (φανερόω)** — MANIFESTED — through ministers like Paul

**Paul didn't CREATE the covenant.** **He ANNOUNCES the covenant that God already cut.**

### **Letter vs. Spirit**

**"Not of the letter but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life."**

This is the **KEY THEOLOGICAL STATEMENT** of the chapter.

**What does "the letter kills" mean?**

**NOT:**

- "The Old Testament is bad"
- "Torah is evil"
- "Law should be ignored"

**YES:**

- "External rules without internal transformation produce DEATH"
- "Stone tablets can only DIAGNOSE the problem, not FIX it"
- "The letter (gramma — γράμμα) without the Spirit produces legalism, which is death"

### **The Two Ways to Read Torah**

|**LETTER (Gramma)**|**SPIRIT (Pneuma)**|
|---|---|
|External compliance|Internal transformation|
|"Do this or be punished"|"This reveals what you are"|
|Law as PRESCRIPTION|Law as DESCRIPTION|
|Produces guilt, striving, death|Produces awakening, rest, life|
|Focuses on BEHAVIOR|Focuses on IDENTITY|

**Example: "You shall be holy, for I am holy" (Leviticus 11:44)**

**LETTER reading:**

- "Try harder to be holy"
- "Clean up your behavior"
- "Achieve moral perfection through effort"

**SPIRIT reading:**

- "You ARE holy because you're IN ME"
- "You share My nature"
- "Your status is KADOSH (insulated to carry My Presence)"
- "Now live FROM that reality, not FOR that reality"

**The LETTER kills because it reveals the standard but provides no power to meet it.**

**The SPIRIT gives life because it WRITES the standard ON YOUR HEART and EMPOWERS you to live it.**

---

## **2 CORINTHIANS 3:7-11 — THE FADING VS. THE PERMANENT**

> "Now if the ministry of death, carved in letters on stone, came with such glory that the Israelites could not gaze at Moses' face because of its glory, which was being brought to an end, will not the ministry of the Spirit have even more glory? For if there was glory in the ministry of condemnation, the ministry of righteousness must far exceed it in glory. Indeed, in this case, what once had glory has come to have no glory at all, because of the glory that surpasses it. For if what was being brought to an end came with glory, much more will what is permanent have glory."

### **The KAVOD (כָּבוֹד) Gradient**

**KAVOD (כָּבוֹד)** — Glory, Weight, Substance, Significance

**Paleo-Hebrew:**

- **Kaf (כ):** Palm, Hand — To Cover, Hold
- **Bet (ב):** House — Dwelling, Inside
- **Vav (ו):** Nail, Hook — Connection
- **Dalet (ד):** Door — Opening, Pathway

**Picture:** The HAND (Kaf) that secures the DWELLING (Bet) by the NAIL (Vav) at the DOOR (Dalet)

**Kavod is the SUBSTANTIAL PRESENCE of God that is so weighty it cannot be moved.**

Paul establishes a **GLORY GRADIENT**:

1. **Old Covenant Glory** (KAVOD on Moses' face)
    
    - **Real** (not fake)
    - **Visible** (Israelites saw it)
    - **Temporary** (fading, being brought to an end)
    - **External** (on Moses' face, not in their hearts)
2. **New Covenant Glory** (KAVOD in believers' hearts)
    
    - **Real** (same source — God)
    - **Invisible to physical eyes** (but discernible by Spirit)
    - **Permanent** (not fading, increasing)
    - **Internal** (written on hearts, transforming from within)

### **Ministry of Death vs. Ministry of Life**

Paul calls the Old Covenant **"ministry of death"** and **"ministry of condemnation."**

**This sounds harsh. What does he mean?**

**The Old Covenant:**

- Revealed the STANDARD (holiness, righteousness)
- Diagnosed the PROBLEM (sin, separation)
- But provided NO POWER to fix it

**The diagnostic tool (Torah) was PERFECT.** **The problem was the PATIENT (humanity in the flesh).**

**Romans 7:12** — "So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good."

**But:**

**Romans 8:3** — "For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do."

**The law was like an X-ray:**

- It shows you the broken bone
- But it doesn't heal the bone
- It just confirms: "Yes, you're broken"

**The Spirit is like the SURGEON:**

- He doesn't just DIAGNOSE
- He OPERATES
- He HEALS
- He TRANSFORMS from the inside out

### **The Fading Glory**

**"The glory which was being brought to an end."**

Moses' face glowed after being in God's presence (Exodus 34:29-35).

But **the glory FADED.**

**Why?**

Because **external glory ALWAYS fades.**

**Stone tablets break.** **Physical temples crumble.** **Outward rituals become empty.**

**But the INTERNAL KAVOD — the Spirit writing on the heart — INCREASES.**

**"From glory to glory"** (coming in verse 18).

---

## **2 CORINTHIANS 3:12-18 — THE VEIL REMOVED**

> "Since we have such a hope, we are very bold, not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face so that the Israelites might not gaze at the outcome of what was being brought to an end. But their minds were hardened. For to this day, when they read the old covenant, that same veil remains unlifted, because only through Christ is it taken away. Yes, to this day whenever Moses is read a veil lies over their hearts. But when one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed. Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image, from one degree of glory to another. For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit."

### **The Veil Theology**

**What was the veil?**

**Physical Veil (Exodus 34:33-35):**

- Moses wore a veil AFTER speaking with God
- He removed the veil when speaking TO God
- He wore the veil when speaking to the people

**Why?**

Paul says: **"So that the Israelites might not gaze at the outcome of what was being brought to an end."**

Moses was **HIDING THE FADING.**

The glory on his face was **TEMPORARY** — it would fade between encounters with God.

The veil prevented the people from seeing the **DIMINISHMENT** of the glory.

### **The Metaphorical Veil**

But Paul shifts from **PHYSICAL veil** (on Moses' face) to **PERCEPTUAL veil** (on the people's hearts).

**"But their minds were hardened. For to this day... that same veil remains unlifted."**

**The veil is now a CONSCIOUSNESS BARRIER.**

**What does the veil represent?**

**THE ILLUSION OF SEPARATION.**

**The veil is:**

- **HAVEL (הֶבֶל)** consciousness — believing you're empty vapor, separated from God
- **RA (רַע)** consciousness — the HEAD (Resh) SEEING (Ayin) for itself, ego-centered perception
- **NASHA (נָשָׁא)** state — forgetting your true position, displaced awareness

**When you read Scripture THROUGH THE VEIL:**

- You see only EXTERNAL RULES (letter)
- You feel only CONDEMNATION (you're not measuring up)
- You experience only DEATH (the killing effect of law without Spirit)

**When you read Scripture WITHOUT THE VEIL:**

- You see IDENTITY REVELATION (Spirit)
- You feel AWAKENING (you're IN CHRIST, complete in Him)
- You experience LIFE (the quickening effect of Spirit-illumined Word)

### **"Only Through Christ Is It Taken Away"**

**"That same veil remains unlifted, because only through Christ is it taken away."**

**Christ is the VEIL-REMOVER.**

**How?**

**At the Cross, the VEIL OF THE TEMPLE was TORN** (Matthew 27:51).

**Two meanings:**

**1. PHYSICAL VEIL (External)**

- The curtain separating Holy Place from Holy of Holies
- Symbolized the BARRIER between God and humanity
- Torn from **TOP TO BOTTOM** (God's action, not man's)

**2. METAPHORICAL VEIL (Internal)**

- **Hebrews 10:20** — "The curtain, that is, his flesh"
- Christ's FLESH was the veil
- His death TORE the veil (removed the barrier)
- Now we have **BOLD ACCESS** to the throne (Hebrews 4:16)

### **The Veil Lies Over Their Hearts**

**"Yes, to this day whenever Moses is read a veil lies over their hearts."**

**This is not about Jewish people specifically.**

**This is about ANYONE who reads Scripture:**

- **FROM THE FLESH** (ego-centered, performance-based)
- **WITHOUT THE SPIRIT** (no internal illumination)
- **UNDER THE LETTER** (external rules, not internal identity)

**The veil is PERCEPTUAL BLINDNESS to:**

- Your position IN CHRIST
- Your identity as the TEMPLE
- Your status as BELOVED SON/DAUGHTER
- The FINISHED WORK of the Cross

**When you operate from HAVEL (vapor) consciousness:**

- You read "Be holy" as STRIVING (try harder)
- You read "Love your neighbor" as DUTY (force yourself)
- You read "Blessed are the pure in heart" as CONDEMNATION (you're not pure enough)

**When you operate from YESH (substance) consciousness:**

- You read "Be holy" as IDENTITY (you ARE holy in Christ)
- You read "Love your neighbor" as OVERFLOW (Christ's love through you)
- You read "Blessed are the pure in heart" as PROMISE (your heart is being purified)

### **"But When One Turns to the Lord"**

**"But when one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed."**

**The word "turns" is EPISTREPHO (ἐπιστρέφω)** — to turn around, to return, to convert.

This is **SHUV (שׁוּב)** in Greek:

**Paleo-Hebrew of SHUV:**

- **Shin (שׁ):** Teeth, Press, Fire
- **Vav (ו):** Connector
- **Bet (ב):** House

**Picture:** The PRESSING/FIRE (Shin) that SECURES (Vav) the return to the HOUSE (Bet)

**When you TURN to the Lord:**

- You shift from **EGO-CENTRIC** to **THEOS-CENTRIC**
- You move from **LETTER** to **SPIRIT**
- You transition from **HAVEL** to **YESH**
- You experience **ZAKAR (זָכַר)** — remembrance, awakening

**The veil doesn't need to be "worked off" through effort.**

**The veil is REMOVED the moment you TURN.**

**This is instantaneous ZAKAR** — surgical remembrance — where the RUACH uses the DABAR (Word) to CUT through the amnesia and ANOINT your consciousness with TRUTH.

### **"The Lord Is the Spirit"**

**"Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."**

**This is a MASSIVE theological statement.**

Paul is equating:

- **The Lord (YHWH/Christ)**
- **The Spirit (RUACH)**

**This is ECHAD (אֶחָד)** — composite unity:

- The **FATHER** (Source, hidden)
- The **SON** (Manifestation, revealed)
- The **SPIRIT** (Connector, bridge)

**They are ONE GOD (Echad), not three separate gods.**

**"Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."**

**FREEDOM (eleutheria — ἐλευθερία)** = Liberty, non-constraint, spaciousness

This is **YASHA (יָשַׁע)** in Greek — salvation as WIDENING, moving from TZAR (constriction) to SPACIOUSNESS.

**The Spirit doesn't bring:**

- More rules
- Tighter restrictions
- Heavier burdens

**The Spirit brings:**

- **MENUHA (מְנוּחָה)** — rest, absence of friction
- **YASHA** — widening, spaciousness, freedom
- **DA'AT (דַּעַת)** — experiential union with God

**This is the opposite of TZAR (צַר)** — constriction, narrow place, distress.

---

## **2 CORINTHIANS 3:18 — THE MIRROR THEOLOGY**

> "And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image, from one degree of glory to another. For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit."

### **The Climax of the Chapter**

This verse is the **THEOLOGICAL SUMMIT** of 2 Corinthians 3.

Let's unpack **EVERY PHRASE**:

### **"We All"**

**Not just apostles.** **Not just super-spiritual people.** **ALL of us who are IN CHRIST.**

This is the **CORPORATE ECHAD** — the entire Body participates.

### **"With Unveiled Face"**

The veil is **REMOVED** (past tense, finished action).

We're not **TRYING** to remove the veil. We're not **WORKING** to remove the veil.

**The veil WAS removed at the Cross.**

Our job is to **RECOGNIZE** (Homologeo) that it's already gone.

### **"Beholding the Glory of the Lord"**

**The Greek word is KATOPTRIZŌ (κατοπτρίζω)** — to behold as in a mirror, to reflect.

**This is MIRROR THEOLOGY.**

**When you look at Christ, you're looking in a MIRROR.**

**Why?**

Because you are the **TSELEM (צֶלֶם)** — the IMAGE — of Christ.

**Christ is the IMAGE of God** (Colossians 1:15). **You are being conformed to the IMAGE of Christ** (Romans 8:29).

**Therefore:**

**When you BEHOLD Christ, you see:**

1. Who HE IS (the glory of God)
2. Who YOU ARE (His image in you)
3. Who YOU'RE BECOMING (transformation into His likeness)

**This is not narcissism.**

**This is RECOGNITION of the TSELEM** — the Image you were created to bear.

### **"Are Being Transformed"**

**The Greek is METAMORPHOŌ (μεταμορφόω)** — metamorphosis, radical transformation.

This is **MAVET (מָוֶת)** in action:

**Paleo-Hebrew of MAVET:**

- **Mem (מ):** Chaos, Water
- **Vav (ו):** Connector
- **Tav (ת):** Cross, Covenant

**Picture:** CHAOS (Mem) CONNECTED (Vav) to COVENANT (Tav)

**Metamorphosis:**

- Caterpillar → Butterfly
- Seed → Fruit
- First Adam → Last Adam

**The transformation is:**

- **PASSIVE VOICE** ("are being transformed" — not "transform yourselves")
- **PRESENT TENSE** ("are being" — ongoing process)
- **DIVINE AGENT** ("For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit")

**This is MONERGISM:**

- God does 100% of the transforming
- You contribute 100% by BEHOLDING (participating through attention)

### **"Into the Same Image"**

**The Greek is EIKŌN (εἰκών)** — image, likeness, representation.

This is **TSELEM (צֶלֶם)** in Greek.

**You're being transformed INTO THE IMAGE you were ALWAYS MEANT TO BE.**

**Not into something NEW.** **Into the ORIGINAL DESIGN.**

**Genesis 1:27** — "God created man in His own image [Tselem]."

**The Fall didn't DESTROY the Tselem.** **The Fall VEILED the Tselem.**

**The Gospel doesn't CREATE a new image.** **The Gospel UNVEILS the original image.**

**You're not BECOMING what you weren't.** **You're MANIFESTING what you've ALWAYS BEEN (in Nistar/hidden reality).**

### **"From One Degree of Glory to Another"**

**The Greek is APO DOXĒS EIS DOXAN (ἀπὸ δόξης εἰς δόξαν)** — from glory to glory.

**This is PROGRESSIVE NIGLEH** — progressive revelation.

**NISTAR (hidden reality):**

- You ARE the image of Christ (Ephesians 1:4, chosen in Him before foundation)
- You POSSESS His Kavod (glory) in fullness

**NIGLEH (revealed reality):**

- The Kavod is PROGRESSIVELY manifested in your experience
- "From glory TO glory" — increasing, not decreasing
- Not "trying to GET glory" but "unveiling the glory ALREADY PRESENT"

**This is the opposite of the OLD COVENANT (fading glory).**

**Old Covenant:** Glory on Moses' face → FADING **New Covenant:** Glory in believers' hearts → INCREASING

**Why?**

Because the **OLD** was **EXTERNAL** (temporary). The **NEW** is **INTERNAL** (permanent).

### **"For This Comes from the Lord Who Is the Spirit"**

**The transformation is:**

- **FROM the Lord** (He's the source)
- **BY the Spirit** (He's the agent)
- **THROUGH beholding** (we're the participants)

**MONERGISM + PARTICIPATION:**

- God does 100% of the work (it "comes from the Lord")
- We contribute 100% participation (by "beholding")

**This is not SYNERGISM** (50% God, 50% us). **This is PARACONSISTENT OPERATION** (100% God, 100% us, both true simultaneously).

---

## **THE COMPLETE SYNTHESIS OF 2 CORINTHIANS 3**

### **The Flow:**

1. **You ARE the letter** (TSELEM — physical manifestation of Christ)
2. **Written by the Spirit** (MONERGISM — God does the writing)
3. **Not with ink, but on hearts** (INTERNAL transformation, not external compliance)
4. **Our sufficiency is FROM God** (KELI principle — empty vessel filled with YESH)
5. **Ministers of a NEW covenant** (SPIRIT, not letter)
6. **The letter kills, the Spirit gives life** (external rules condemn, internal Spirit transforms)
7. **The Old had fading glory** (EXTERNAL, temporary, stone)
8. **The New has increasing glory** (INTERNAL, permanent, heart)
9. **The veil remains until Christ** (CONSCIOUSNESS barrier, not physical)
10. **When one turns, the veil is removed** (SHUV — return, awakening, Zakar)
11. **Where the Spirit is, there is freedom** (YASHA — widening, spaciousness, Menuha)
12. **Beholding transforms us** (MIRROR theology — seeing Christ = seeing yourself)
13. **From glory to glory** (PROGRESSIVE NIGLEH — unveiling what's already true)
14. **This comes from the Spirit** (MONERGISM — God doing 100% of the work)

---

## **CLOSING APPLICATION**

### **How to Read Scripture WITHOUT the Veil**

**Next time you read the Bible, ask:**

**Am I reading this FROM:**

1. **HAVEL consciousness** (empty, striving, separated)?
2. Or **YESH consciousness** (filled, resting, IN CHRIST)?

**Am I reading this AS:**

1. **LETTER** (external rules I must obey)?
2. Or **SPIRIT** (identity revelation showing me who I AM)?

**Am I experiencing:**

1. **DEATH** (condemnation, guilt, striving)?
2. Or **LIFE** (awakening, transformation, rest)?

### **The Mirror Test**

**When you look at Christ:**

**Do you see:**

1. **A DISTANT IDEAL** (someone you can never be)?
2. Or **A MIRROR** (reflecting who you ALREADY ARE in Him)?

**If you see distance:**

- The veil is still there (HAVEL consciousness)
- You're reading from the LETTER (external standard)
- You're experiencing DEATH (condemnation)

**If you see reflection:**

- The veil is removed (YESH consciousness)
- You're reading from the SPIRIT (internal identity)
- You're experiencing LIFE (transformation)

### **The Transformation Guarantee**

**2 Corinthians 3:18 is a PROMISE:**

**"We all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, ARE BEING TRANSFORMED."**

**Not "might be" or "could be" or "should try to be."**

**ARE BEING.**

**Present tense. Passive voice. Guaranteed outcome.**

**Your job is NOT:**

- To transform yourself
- To try harder
- To measure up

**Your job IS:**

- **BEHOLD** (keep your eyes on Christ)
- **RECOGNIZE** (agree with what God says about you)
- **YIELD** (let the Spirit do the transforming)

**The LOOKING produces the CHANGING.**

**The BEHOLDING produces the BECOMING.**

---

**That's 2 Corinthians 3.**

**The chapter that TEARS THE VEIL.**

**The chapter that shifts us from:**

- **EXTERNAL RELIGION** → **INTERNAL REALITY**
- **LETTER** → **SPIRIT**
- **DEATH** → **LIFE**
- **FADING GLORY** → **INCREASING GLORY**
- **VEILED FACE** → **UNVEILED FACE**
- **TRYING TO BECOME** → **BEHOLDING WHO WE ARE**

**You are the LETTER.**

**Written by the SPIRIT.**

**On tablets of FLESH.**

**And every time you BEHOLD Christ, you're being TRANSFORMED into the IMAGE you were ALWAYS meant to be.**

**From glory to glory.**

**By the Lord who is the Spirit.**

Now let's move forward. 🔥
