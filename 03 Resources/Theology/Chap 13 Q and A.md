# Chap 13 Q and A

**Backlink:** [[2 Corinthians 13 - The Test of Reality]]

---

## **Q1 - What does it mean that Christ's power is made perfect in weakness?**

Based on the **"Seed Protocol"** outlined in the chapter, this concept reframes weakness not as a failure, but as the **mechanism** for divine power.

The text explains that Christ was "crucified **from** (sourced in) weakness" but "lives **by** the power of God" (v.4). This establishes a pattern:
*   **Weakness (The Shell Breaking):** This represents mortal limitation, submission, and the end of self-sufficiency. It is the seed falling into the ground and dying (crucifixion).
*   **Power (The Seed Emerging):** Resurrection life flows **out of** that very weakness.

Therefore, for us to say Christ's power is made perfect in weakness means we are **participating** in this pattern. We do not just imitate His weakness; we are "weak **in Him**" (union with His crucifixion) so that we may "live **with Him** by the power of God." It implies that our human limitations are the **optimal environment** for God's monergistic power to be displayed, rather than obstacles to be overcome by human strength.

## **Q2 - How does Self-examination differ from self-criticism?**

Paul’s command to "examine yourselves" (v.5) is distinct from self-criticism in its nature and goal:

*   **Self-Examination (Diagnosis):** This is like a doctor examining a patient. It is an objective assessment of **reality** - specifically, "Do you **realize** that Jesus Christ is in you?" It is defined as **Zakar** (remembrance/waking up) to an existing truth. It asks, "Am I operating from the reality of Christ in me, or from *Havel* (vapor/emptiness)?"
*   **Self-Criticism (Judgment):** This often involves measuring oneself against external standards of *performance*, spiritual achievement, or credentials. The Corinthians were obsessed with "proof" (miracles, eloquence, status).

Self-examination seeks to **confirm identity** (Christ in you), whereas self-criticism seeks to **validate worth** through performance. The former leads to waking up; the latter leads to condemnation or pride.

## **Q3 - Paul warns the church that he will not spare them when he returns, what do you think prompted him to take such a firm stance? What might have happened if he had stayed lenient?**

Paul’s firmness is prompted by his role as an **Ezer** (Guardian-Warrior) and the necessity of protecting the *Bride* (the Church) from corruption.

*   **The Prompt:** Paul had already visited twice (one being a "painful visit") and sent a severe letter, yet rebellion and false teaching persisted. The "disease" of sin and false identity was threatening the life of the body.
*   ** The Consequence of Leniency:** If Paul remained lenient, the "sickness" would remain. The text states: "**The DISEASE must be cut out before it kills the BODY.**" A refusal to use his authority for "tearing down" the strongholds would result in a corrupted foundation, leaving the church built on *Havel* (human strength) rather than *Yesh* (divine substance). His severity is actually an act of love - using the "sword" (Zayin) to protect the integrity of the community.

## **Q4 - How do we balance grace and accountability in our own relationships, whether in a church, family or community?**

The chapter offers a model for this balance through the **implied father heart** of Paul (vv. 7-10) and the **final exhortations** (v. 11):

1.  **Aim for Restoration (Katartisis):** Accountability should always be redemptive. The goal isn't control or punishment, but *mending* (like fixing a net) to make the person whole (*Tamim*).
2.  **Comfort One Another (Parakaleo):** We act as *Ezermates* - standing alongside to encourage and admonish.
3.  **Grace as the Context:** Paul prefers to appear "weak" (not needing to punish) so that they can be "strong" (doing what is right). He doesn't prioritize his own vindication but their restoration.
4.  **Peace (Shalom) through Integrity:** "Live in peace" doesn't mean avoiding conflict, but achieving wholeness (*Shalom*). Sometimes "tearing down" (confrontation) is necessary to "build up" the relationship on a true foundation.

We balance grace and accountability by ensuring our *motive* is always the other person's maturity (restoration) rather than our own convenience or pride.

## **Q5 - How does this chapter challenge or encourage you personally? Is there anything here you feel I should be called to act on?**

**Personal Challenge & Encouragement:**
The core challenge of this chapter is the **Ultimate Question**: *"Do you not realize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?"*
It challenges the tendency to look for external validation - whether it be "credentials," spiritual experiences, or the approval of others (like the Corinthians testing Paul). The encouragement is that **Monergistic Grace** is already ours; we don't have to earn it, we just have to "wake up" to it.

**Call to Action:**
You may be called to **stop "testing"** - stop testing God, stop testing your leaders, and stop testing your own worthiness based on performance. Instead, **start "Resting"** in the reality that Christ is *already* in you.
*   **Act:** "Rejoice, aim for restoration, comfort one another."
*   **Shift:** Move from **Havel-consciousness** (feeling empty and needing to fill yourself with achievements) to **Yesh-consciousness** (realizing you are a vessel containing the very substance of God).
*   **Pray:** The Trinitarian Benediction - boldly claim the "Grace of the Son, Love of the Father, and Fellowship of the Spirit" as your present reality, not a future reward.
