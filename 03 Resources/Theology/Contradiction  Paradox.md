Whether it is "logical" to say God is paradoxical depends heavily on how you define **logic** and how you define **paradox**.

In philosophy and theology, the claim that God is paradoxical is not usually an admission that God is irrational or impossible. Rather, it is an acknowledgement that an infinite being cannot be fully captured by finite human language or binary logic.

Here is a breakdown of the different ways this question is answered.

### 1. The Distinction Between Contradiction and Paradox

To determine if it is logical, we must distinguish between two concepts:

- **A Contradiction:**
    
    and  existing at the same time in the same sense. (e.g., "God is fully good and fully evil.") In strict logic, contradictions are false. If God is a contradiction, God cannot exist.
    
      
    
- **A Paradox (Antinomy):** Two statements that seem contradictory but may both be true in a way that transcends current understanding or perspective. (e.g., "God is far away [transcendent] and right here [immanent].")
    

It is logical to say God is paradoxical if you mean that **divine attributes exist in a tension that human reason struggles to reconcile.**

### 2. The Argument for "Yes" (The Epistemological View)

Many theologians and philosophers argue that it is strictly logical to expect God to be paradoxical. This is based on the difference between the "container" (the human mind) and the "contents" (the infinite).

- **Finite vs. Infinite:** If God is infinite and the human mind is finite, any attempt to describe God will result in a breakdown of standard categories. If we _could_ fully explain God without paradox, we would be describing something finite, not God.
    
- **Nicholas of Cusa and the _Coincidentia Oppositorum_:** The 15th-century philosopher argued that God is the "coincidence of opposites." In geometry, as a circle grows infinitely large, its curve eventually becomes indistinguishable from a straight line. In the infinite, opposites (curve and line) merge. Therefore, saying God is paradoxical is the most accurate logical statement we can make.
    
- **Analogy of Dimensions:** Imagine a 2D square trying to understand a 3D cylinder. From the side, the cylinder looks like a square; from the top, it looks like a circle. To the 2D mind, the object is a "paradox" (it is both square and circle). It is not illogical; it simply possesses a higher dimensionality.
    

### 3. The Common Theological Paradoxes

Major monotheistic traditions rely on paradoxical tensions to describe God's nature:

- **Mercy and Justice:** Perfect justice requires punishment for every wrong. Perfect mercy requires forgiveness. Logically, these seem mutually exclusive. Theologically, God is said to be fully both.
    
- **Sovereignty and Free Will:** God controls everything, yet humans are responsible for their choices.
    
- **Transcendence and Immanence:** God is entirely distinct from the universe (outside time/space) yet entirely present within every atom of it.
    

### 4. The Argument for "No" (The Analytic View)

Strict analytic philosophers might argue that saying "God is paradoxical" is a cop-out. They argue that if a concept violates the **Law of Non-Contradiction**, it is incoherent.

- **The Omnipotence Paradox:** "Can God create a rock so heavy He cannot lift it?" If yes, He isn't omnipotent (can't lift it). If no, He isn't omnipotent (can't create it).
    
- **The Logical Solution:** Most philosophers (like Aquinas and C.S. Lewis) resolve this by clarifying definitions. They argue that "nonsense remains nonsense even when we talk about God." Being omnipotent means having the power to do all that is _logically possible_. Creating a "square circle" or a "rock too heavy for an all-powerful being" are not tasks; they are errors in words. Therefore, God is not paradoxical; our language is just sloppy.
    

### 5. Conclusion: Supra-logical, not Illogical

Is it logical to say God is paradoxical?

**Yes,** if you view God as **"Supra-logical"** (above logic).If God exists as the creator of the framework of reality (including logic), He may not be bound by its rules in the way we are. As the physicist Niels Bohr once said, "The opposite of a correct statement is a false statement. But the opposite of a profound truth may well be another profound truth."

In this sense, calling God "paradoxical" is a logical recognition of the limits of human reason.
