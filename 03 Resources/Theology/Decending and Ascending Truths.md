# Descending and Ascending Truths

You are now walking on the razor’s edge of high theology! This is where you have to be very careful with your phrasing, or you will slip from **Mystical Monotheism** (God is united with humanity) into **Pantheism** (God _is_ just humanity/universe).

The short answer is: **Yes, you can say this, but it requires an "Asymmetrical" understanding.**

If you say "To be Human is to be Divine" as a flat, mathematical equals sign (

𝐴

=

𝐵

A = B

A=B

  

), you lose God's transcendence. You need to nuance it. Here is the supra-logical breakdown of that statement:

  

### 1. "To be Divine is to be Human" (The Descending Truth)

This part is the Incarnation.

- **Is it true?** Yes, in the sense that God, in His freedom, chose to include Humanity into His own identity through Christ.
    
- **The Paraconsistent nuance:** God is not _limited_ to being human, but He is _truly_ human.
    
- **The Nigerian Context:** Think of a very wealthy **Philanthropist** who chooses to live in a slum to help the people.
    

- In that moment, "To be the Rich Man is to be a Slum-dweller."
    
- _However_, if he leaves the slum, he is still rich. His "richness" is not defined by the slum, but his "love" is defined by his presence there.
    
- **Theology:** God does not _need_ to be human to be God (He was God before [[ADAM|Adam]]), but He _chose_ to become human to be a **Savior**.
    

### 2. "To be Human is to be Divine" (The Ascending Truth)

This part is what the Eastern Orthodox Church calls **Theosis** (Deification).

- **Is it true?** It is true of the _perfect_ human (Christ), and it is the _destiny_ of believers, but it is not automatically true of every guy on the street.
    
- **The Danger:** If you just say "To be Human is to be Divine," you might accidentally say that a wicked man, a killer, or a liar is "God." That creates a moral contradiction, not just a logical one.
    
- **The Correction:** You should say, _"To be fully Human is to participate in the Divine."_
    

- We are currently "broken humans." We are less than human because of sin/imperfection.
    
- When we become fully united with God, we become "True Humans."
    
- **St. Athanasius (Church Father) famously said:** _"God became man so that man might become god."_ (Note the lowercase 'g'—we become _like_ Him, sharing His life, but we don't become the Creator).
    

### 3. The "Mirror" Analogy (To visualize the asymmetry)

Imagine a mirror reflecting the Sun.

- **Statement A:** "The Sun is in the Mirror." (True. The light is fully there).
    
- **Statement B:** "The Mirror is the Sun." (False—if you destroy the mirror, the Sun still burns. If you destroy the Sun, the mirror goes dark).
    

So, your statement works if you view it through **Union**, not **Identity**.

- **Identity (Bad Logic):** Human = God. (This implies I can worship my neighbor as the Creator).
    
- **Union (Supra-Logic):** God and Humanity are distinct natures that are inextricably wedded together.
    

### 4. How to phrase it "Proof-Resistently"

If you want to say this in a way that is profound but defends against the "You are calling yourself God" accusation, try this structure:

> "I believe that the Divine has chosen to define Himself by His humanity (Christ), and Humanity finds its true definition only in the Divine. They are distinct, yet in the ultimate reality, they are inseparable. You cannot fully know God without looking at a Man (Jesus), and you cannot know what it means to be a Man without looking at God."

### 5. A Nigerian Analogy for this specific statement

**The "King's Adoption" Analogy**

- **Scenario:** A King adopts a street child and makes him the Prince.
    
- **The Logic:**
    

- The King has become a "Father to a street child." (The Divine becomes Human-related).
    
- The Street Child has become "The Son of the King." (The Human becomes Divine-related).
    

- **The Paraconsistency:**
    

- The blood in the boy's veins is still street blood (Human nature).
    
- The status of the boy is Royal (Divine nature).
    
- **The Statement:** "To look at this boy is to look at Royalty."
    

- **The "Hole" Prevention:** If someone says, "So the boy is the King?" You say, "No, the boy is _united_ to the King. But the union is so strong that if you slap the boy, you slap the King."
    

### Verdict

You can say it! But if you are pressed, clarify that it is a **union of love**, not a **confusion of essence**. God remains the source; Humanity remains the vessel. But the vessel is now filled with the Source forever.
