**WORD:** **[[EHYEH|Ehyeh]]** (Hebrew)

**Standard Meaning:** "I AM" or "I WILL BE."

**My Insight:** God is not a static object to be defined, but a dynamic Event to be experienced. His Name implies active movement toward humanity. He _became_ flesh to fulfill His promise. Salvation is God "happening" to us.

**Scripture:** Exodus 3:14 (_"I WILL BE that I AM"_); John 8:58. The name that was a promise.

**WORD:** **Monergism** (Theological Term)

**Standard Meaning:** The doctrine that God acts alone in the work of salvation (Mono = One, Ergon = Work).

**My Insight:** Salvation is not a partnership (50/50). It is sustained entirely by the "Faith **of** God"—His loyalty to His own character. He saves us to protect His reputation, not because of our potential.

**Scripture:** Isaiah 59:16 (_"His arm brought salvation unto him"_); 2 Timothy 2:13.

**WORD:** **[[YESH|Yesh]]** (Hebrew)

**Standard Meaning:** Existence, Substance, Being, "There is."

**My Insight:** This represents **Objective Reconciliation**. Humanity has "being" and "substance" in God because of the Finished Work. The sinner exists in God's provision but is asleep to the relationship. It is the legal reality before the experience.

**Scripture:** Acts 17:28 (_"In him we live, and move, and have our being"_); Proverbs 8:21.

**WORD:** **[[KAVOD|Kavod]]** (Hebrew)

**Standard Meaning:** Glory, Weight, Honor, Abundance.

**My Insight:** The difference between a "reconciled" person (Yesh) and a "saved" person is their awareness. Faith moves us from merely existing in God to carrying the **weight** (manifestation) of His presence. It is the glory that Jesus transfers to us.

**Scripture:** John 17:22 (_"The glory which thou gavest me I have given them"_).

**WORD:** **[[ASHER|Asher]]** (Hebrew)

**Standard Meaning:** Who, Which, That (The relative pronoun/connector).

**My Insight:** In the name _Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh_, this is the Bridge. It represents the Spirit connecting the Source (Father) to the Manifestation (Son). In us, faith acts as the _Asher_—the connection point where the "I AM" flows into our specific situation.

**Scripture:** Exodus 3:14 (The middle word).

**WORD:** **[[YASHA|Yasha]]** (Hebrew)

**Standard Meaning:** To Save, To Deliver, To Liberate.

**My Insight:** Literally means "to make wide" or "to create space." Salvation is God pulling us out of the narrow, crushing canyon of self-effort and placing us in the wide, open field of Grace. It is the removal of constriction.

**Scripture:** Psalm 18:19 (_"He brought me forth also into a large place"_).

---

**WORD:** **[[TZAR|Tzar]]** (Hebrew)

**Standard Meaning:** Enemy, Trouble, Distress, Narrow.

**My Insight:** The opposite of Salvation. It describes the state of the human soul trying to save itself—constricted, anxious, and tight. Religion binds; Salvation (Yasha) looses.

**Scripture:** Psalm 118:5 (_"I called upon the LORD in distress [Tzar]"_).

---

**WORD:** **Yeshua** (Hebrew)

**Standard Meaning:** Jesus / The LORD Saves.

**My Insight:** The Pictographs (Yod-Shin-Vav-Ayin) tell the Gospel story: "The **Hand** (Yod) of God... **Destroys** (Shin) the works of the enemy... using the **Nail** (Vav)... to give us **Sight** (Ayin)."

**Scripture:** Isaiah 49:16 (_"I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands"_).

---

**WORD:** **[[HOMOLOGEO|Homologeo]]** (Greek)

**Standard Meaning:** To Confess.

**My Insight:** Literally "to say the same thing" (_Homo_ = Same, _Logos_ = Word). It is not a password we speak to convince God to save us; it is our agreement with the verdict God has already spoken. We say "Amen" to His "It is Finished."

**Scripture:** Romans 10:9; 2 Corinthians 5:19.
