This is a **radical** and fascinating position. By removing the Christian "relational" guardrails and stepping into pure paraconsistency, you are advocating for what philosophers call **Radical Non-Dualism** (or in Sanskirt, _Advaita_—"Not Two").

In this framework, **yes**, it is perfectly paraconsistent to say "To be Human is Divine, and to be Divine is Human."

Here is why your view holds up in a supra-logical framework, and how to articulate this "Identity" (rather than just Union) without distinctions.

### The Logic: The Collapse of the Boundary

In classical logic, identity requires total agreement of properties (

𝐴

=

𝐴

A = A

A=A

  

).

  

In your paraconsistent view, you are arguing that the **distinction** between the definitions of "God" (Infinite) and "Human" (Finite) is actually a **cognitive illusion** created by the human mind.

  

You are effectively saying:

- The "Human" is just the "Divine" viewed through a narrow lens.
    
- The "Divine" is just the "Human" viewed without the lens.
    
- **Therefore, the Substance is One.**
    

Here are 5 Nigerian-context analogies that argue for **Identity** (they are the same thing) rather than just Union.

### 1. The "Yam and Pounded Yam" Analogy (Substance Monism)

This is the strongest argument for identity.

- **The Scenario:** You have a tuber of Yam in the barn. You also have a bowl of Pounded Yam (Iyan) on the table.
    
- **The Distinctions (The Illusion):**
    

- The Yam looks brown, hard, and hairy.
    
- The Pounded Yam looks white, soft, and steaming.
    
- Logic says they are different forms.
    

- **The Paraconsistent Reality:** The Pounded Yam **IS** the Yam. It hasn't "united" with the yam. It is the yam, simply rearranged.
    

- If you eat the human (experience humanity), you are tasting the Divine.
    
- To be the pounded yam is to be the yam. There is no line where the yam stops and the pounded yam begins. It is one substance in different modes.
    

### 2. The "Dreamer" Analogy (The Mind of God)

This removes the "external" world entirely.

- **The Scenario:** You go to sleep in Abuja and dream you are a market woman in Kano selling pepper.
    
- **The Question:** In the dream, is the market woman "you"?
    
- **The Reality:**
    

- The market woman has a name, a history, and feels pain.
    
- But the market woman is made _entirely_ of your consciousness.
    

- **The Identity:** The character (Human) **is** the Dreamer (Divine).
    

- If the Dreamer wakes up, the character vanishes.
    
- While the dream lasts, there is no atom of that woman that is not you.
    
- **Conclusion:** You (the Human) are just God dreaming He is you. There is no "you" separate from Him.
    

### 3. The "Lagos Bar Beach" Analogy (The Wave and the Ocean)

This attacks the dichotomy of "Individual" vs. "Whole."

- **The Scenario:** You stand at the beach and watch a massive wave crash.
    
- **The Dichotomy:** We point and say, "Look at that wave." We treat the wave as an object separate from the ocean.
    
- **The Truth:** The "wave" does not exist. There is no such thing as a wave. There is only the Ocean doing a specific movement.
    

- The wave **is** the Ocean.
    
- The Ocean **is** the wave (in that moment).
    

- **The Application:** You (Human) are a "waveing" of God. You are not a separate bucket of water. You are the Divine in motion. To distinguish the wave from the water is unnecessary and false.
    

### 4. The "Electricity and the Bulb" Analogy

This argues against the separation of "Power" and "Form."

- **The Scenario:** You look at a shining street light.
    
- **The View:** You see "Light."
    
- **The Reality:** What you call "Light" is actually just Electricity forcing its way through a filament.
    
- **The Identity:** The Light **is** the Electricity made visible.
    

- You cannot say, "Here is the electricity, and there is the light." No. The light is the _activity_ of the electricity.
    
- **To be Human (Light)** is simply **to be Divine (Electricity)** in a visible frequency. They are the same event.
    

### 5. The "Clay Pot" Analogy (Olowo-Idere)

This is a classic philosophical analogy adapted.

- **The Scenario:** A potter molds a pot out of clay.
    
- **The Question:** Where does the clay end and the pot begin?
    
- **The Paraconsistent Answer:** Nowhere.
    

- The Pot has a shape (Humanity/Finitude).
    
- The Pot has a substance (Clay/Divinity).
    

- **The Identity:** The Pot **is** the Clay.
    

- If you break the pot, you find only clay.
    
- If you analyze the human, you find only God.
    
- The "shape" (your humanity) is just a temporary curve in the reality of God.
    

### How to defend this "No Line" Stance

If you hold this view, you are essentially arguing that **Reality is One**. The only reason we see "God" and "Man" as two things is because we are looking through the kaleidoscope of the mind.

If someone challenges you, saying "But I am weak, and God is strong, so we are different," your paraconsistent response is:

> "Your weakness is an illusion of perspective. Just as a movie character seems to struggle on screen but is actually just light on a wall, your human struggle is the Divine experiencing a story. There is no 'you' to be weak. There is only the Divine playing the role of you."

This is the ultimate supra-logical stance: **The distinctions are not real.**
