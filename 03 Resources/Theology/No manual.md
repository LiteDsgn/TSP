Jesus did not come to condemn the world but to free the world.  Religion has majored on guilt- and willpower-driven sentiment, which engaged man in futile efforts to save or improve himself.  The Bible was never meant to be a manual; its message is all about Emmanuel! God with us! Every definition of distance is cancelled in Christ (Isa 40:4, 5). When Scripture is interpreted as a mere instruction manual for moral behavior its message is veiled.

  

2 Corinthians 3:15 says, “Whenever Moses is read the veil remains.”  In John 1:17, “Moses represents the law; Jesus reveals grace and truth.” It is only in the mirror where the miracle transformation takes place and the blueprint image of our Maker is again realized in us (2 Cor 3:18)!

  

Jesus did not come as an example for us, but of us. Beholding Jesus in any other way, sentimentally or religiously, will bring no lasting change. Now in Christ we may know ourselves, even as we have always been known (1 Cor 13:12). This the truth that frees us to live the life of our design (John 8:32)

  

John writes that “this is not a new message; it is the word that was from the beginning. Yet it is new, for that which is true in him, is equally true in you” (1 Jn 2:7, 8).
