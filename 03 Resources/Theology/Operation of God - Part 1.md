This is the climax of the investigation. The title **"Son of Man"** is the perfect key that unlocks how all these disparates pieces—Suffering, Substance (_Yesh_), Glory (_Kavod_), and God (_HaShem_)—fit together in one Person.

Here is the connection: **The Son of Man is the only vessel strong enough to hold "[[YESH|Yesh]]" (Divine Reality) within "[[ADAM|Adam]]" (Human Frailty).**

Here is the breakdown of how the Son of Man fulfills every concept we have discussed:

### 1. The Connection to Lamentations 3 & Psalm 5 (The Suffering Intercessor)

In Lamentations and Psalms, we saw a voice **groaning** under the weight of "plots," "vengeance," and "wickedness."

**The Problem:** Mere humans (sons of Adam) are crushed by this suffering. They cannot bear the full weight of the world's sin.

**The Son of Man:** Jesus adopted the title "Son of Man" primarily when predicting His suffering (Mark 8:31).

He is the voice in Lamentations 3:60 saying, _"You have seen their plots."_

He is the groaning in Psalm 5.

**The Connection:** As the Son of Man, He entered the "grave" (Ps 5:9) and absorbed the "vengeance" (Lam 3:60) so that He could intercede for us. He is the "Man of Sorrows" who validates the Spirit's groaning.

### 2. The Connection to Proverbs 8 (The Bringer of _Yesh_)

We established that Wisdom (Proverbs 8) offers _Yesh_—solid, existing Substance—rather than shadow.

**The Context:** In the book of Daniel (chapter 7), the prophet sees a vision of world empires. He sees them as **Beasts**. beasts are chaotic, violent, and temporary. They have no permanent _Yesh_.

**The Vision:** Then, Daniel sees **"One like a Son of Man"** coming on the clouds.

**The Connection:** The Son of Man is the only One who receives an **everlasting** kingdom.

In John 6:27, Jesus (The Son of Man) says: _"Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures... which the_ **_Son of Man_** _will give you."_

Jesus is saying: _"I am the One from Proverbs 8. I am the Bringer of Substance. Everything else is a 'Beast' that will rot. I give you Yesh."_

### 3. The Connection to _Kavod_ (The Weight of Glory)

We defined _Kavod_ as the "Heaviness" or "Glory" that comes from having true Substance.

**The Old Testament Tension:** In the OT, if a "Son of Man" (a human) touched the _Kavod_ (Glory) of God, he died. Humanity was too "lightweight" to bear the weight of God.

**The Daniel 7 Link:** Daniel 7:14 says of the Son of Man: _"To him was given dominion and_ **_Glory ([[KAVOD|Kavod]])_** _and a kingdom."_

**The Connection:** Jesus is the paradox. He is a "Son of Man" (fully human), yet He carries the full weight of the _Kavod_ without being destroyed.

When John says, _"We beheld his_ **_glory_**_"_ (John 1:14), he is saying: _"We saw a Son of Man carrying the full weight of [[HASHEM|HaShem]]."_

### 4. The Bridge: From "[[HAVEL|Havel]]" to "HaShem"

This is the most technical but beautiful connection.

**Man's Default State:** The Bible calls humans _Havel_ (vapor/breath)—the opposite of _Yesh_.

**God's State:** He is _HaShem_—the I AM.

**The Son of Man:** He is the Ladder (John 1:51).

The "Son of Man" takes the **Groaning** of the vapor (us, from Lamentations/Psalms), fills it with the **Substance** (_Yesh_ from Proverbs), and clothes it in **Glory** (_Kavod_), so that human beings can stand in the presence of **HaShem**.

### Summary of the Picture

**Lamentations 3:60 / Psalm 5:** The Son of Man is the **Suffering Servant** on earth, crying out, "Father, see their plots!"

**Proverbs 8:21:** The Son of Man is the **Divine Wisdom** in heaven, saying, "I have Substance for you."

**Daniel 7:** The Son of Man is the **King**, uniting earth and heaven, inheriting the _Kavod_ that Adam lost.

He is the Groaning Man, the Substantive God, and the Glorious King all in one title.
