To show that salvation rests on God’s faithfulness rather than our own reliability, you need to look at verses that describe salvation as **monergistic** (a work of God alone) regarding its origin, power, and security.

Here are the strongest arguments and scriptures that are free from the "faith in/faith of" translation debate.

### 1. The Argument of "Deadness" (Ephesians 2:4–5)

This is perhaps the strongest logical proof. Paul describes the pre-saved state not as "sick" or "willing but weak," but as **dead**. A dead person cannot generate faith; they must be made alive first.

> _"But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, Even when we were dead in sins,_ **_hath quickened us_** _[made us alive] together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)"_ — **Ephesians 2:4–5**

- **The Point:** Resurrection is not a cooperative effort. Lazarus did not help Jesus raise him. If God made us alive while we were dead, the initiative and the power were 100% His.
    

### 2. The Argument of "The Gift" (Ephesians 2:8–9)

While this verse mentions faith, the sentence structure emphasizes that the entire package of salvation—including the faith to believe—is a gift from God, so that no human can claim they were "smart enough" or "faithful enough" to choose God.

> _"For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that_ **_not of yourselves_**_: it is the_ **_gift of God_**_: Not of works, lest any man should boast."_ — **Ephesians 2:8–9**

- **The Point:** If the faith required to be saved is a gift _from_ God, then the credit for that faith belongs to the Giver, not the receiver.
    

### 3. The Argument of "God's Fidelity vs. Our Failure" (2 Timothy 2:13)

This is the clearest verse distinguishing between human faithlessness and God’s faithfulness. It anchors our security in His character, not our performance.

> _"If we believe not, yet_ **_he abideth faithful_**_: he cannot deny himself."_ — **2 Timothy 2:13**

- **The Point:** Even when our faith wavers or fails, God remains faithful to His covenant because His promise is based on _His_ nature ("He cannot deny himself"), not on our consistency.
    

### 4. The Argument of "Timing" (Romans 5:6, 8, 10)

Paul emphasizes _when_ God saved us to prove that it wasn't based on our faithfulness.

> _"For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly... God commendeth his love toward us, in that,_ **_while we were yet sinners_**_, Christ died for us... For if,_ **_when we were enemies_**_, we were reconciled to God..."_ — **Romans 5:6, 8, 10**

- **The Point:** God didn't wait for us to become faithful. He acted when we were "without strength" (helpless), "sinners," and "enemies." If He saved us when we were enemies, our salvation cannot be sustained by our friendliness.
    

### 5. The Argument of "The Origin" (Titus 3:4–5)

This passage strips away any human contribution—including our "righteousness" or religious acts—and places the burden entirely on God’s mercy.

> _"But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,_ **_Not by works of righteousness which we have done_**_, but according to his mercy he saved us..."_ — **Titus 3:4–5**

- **The Point:** If salvation is not by works of righteousness, it is also not by "works of faith" (viewing faith as a meritorious act we perform). It is "according to His mercy."
    

### 6. The Argument of "The Finisher" (Philippians 1:6)

If salvation depended on our faithfulness, we could lose it the moment we lost faith. However, Paul is confident in _God's_ ability to finish the project.

> _"Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath_ **_begun_** _a good work in you_ **_will perform it_** _until the day of Jesus Christ."_ — **Philippians 1:6**

- **The Point:** You did not begin the work, and you are not the one ensuring it gets finished. The burden of maintenance is on the Creator, not the creation.
    

### Summary for your study:

To prove salvation is by God's faithfulness, focus on **Covenant** and **Character**:

1. **Covenant:** God made a promise to Abraham (and Christ) that was unilateral—He walked through the pieces of the sacrifice alone (Genesis 15).
    
2. **Character:** Salvation is about God demonstrating _His_ righteousness (Romans 3:25-26), not God rewarding _our_ faithfulness.
