# Salvation is of the Lord - Part 2

To support the truth found in **Isaiah 45:17**—that salvation is an everlasting work done _in_ the Lord and sustained by _His_ character—here are key Old Testament scriptures.

These passages demonstrate that salvation is not a partnership where God does 50% and we do 50%. Instead, they show God acting unilaterally because human faithfulness was totally absent.

### 1. Isaiah 59:16 – The "Arm" that Saves Alone

This is perhaps the strongest companion to your request. It depicts God looking for anyone with enough faith or righteousness to intervene, finding no one, and deciding to do it Himself.

> _"And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor:_ **_therefore his arm brought salvation unto him_**_; and his righteousness, it sustained him."_

- **The Type of Jesus:** In Isaiah 53:1, the Messiah is referred to as "the Arm of the Lord."
    
- **The Faith Aspect:** God did not rely on human cooperation. His own "righteousness" (His faithfulness to His own nature) is what "sustained" the work of salvation.
    

### 2. Genesis 15:12, 17 – The Unilateral Covenant (Abraham’s Deep Sleep)

When God made the covenant with Abraham, it was customary for both parties to walk between the cut animals, signifying "If I break this promise, may I be torn apart like these animals." However, God caused a deep sleep to fall on Abraham.

> _"And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp [symbols of God's presence] that_ **_passed between those pieces_**_."_

- **The Type of Jesus:** This foreshadows the Cross, where God (in Christ) took the full weight of the covenant upon Himself.
    
- **The Faith Aspect:** Abraham was asleep (totally passive). He contributed nothing to the ratification of the covenant. God walked it alone, meaning the "faith" to keep the covenant depends entirely on God.
    

### 3. Ezekiel 36:22, 32 – Saved for "His Name’s Sake"

This passage destroys the idea that God saves us because we are "worth it." He saves us to protect His own reputation of faithfulness.

> _"Therefore say unto the house of Israel... I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for_ **_mine holy name's sake_**_... Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord GOD, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways..."_

- **The Type of Jesus:** Jesus acted to glorify the Father.
    
- **The Faith Aspect:** The "battery" encompassing this salvation is God's jealous love for His own Name. As long as God loves His own glory, your salvation is secure. It is sustained by His integrity, not yours.
    

### 4. Hosea 2:19-20 – Betrothed in HIS Faithfulness

In the story of Hosea, God commands the prophet to marry an unfaithful woman (a type of Israel/the Church). God then makes a promise to betroth His people to Himself forever.

> _"And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies. I will even betroth thee unto me_ **_in faithfulness_**_: and thou shalt know the LORD."_

- **The Type of Jesus:** The Bridegroom who washes the Bride (Ephesians 5).
    
- **The Faith Aspect:** Notice the text says "in faithfulness." This is God's faithfulness. He marries us using His own fidelity as the bond, knowing that we (like Gomer) are naturally unfaithful.
    

### 5. Jeremiah 23:6 – The Name is the Security

This prophecy gives the Messiah a specific name that defines the mechanism of our salvation.

> _"In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called,_ **_THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS_**_."_

- **The Type of Jesus:** Jesus is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification (1 Cor 1:30).
    
- **The Faith Aspect:** If the Lord _is_ our righteousness, then our standing is not sustained by our "faith acting right," but by His very existence. As long as He exists, we are righteous.
    

### 6. Psalm 98:1-3 – The Victory of His Hand

> _"O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvelous things:_ **_his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory_**_... He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel."_

- **The Type of Jesus:** Victory over sin and death (1 Corinthians 15:57).
    
- **The Faith Aspect:** The victory was "gotten" (obtained) by His hand, not our hands. We simply receive the spoils of a war He fought and won alone.
    

  

Here are five of the clearest, most undeniable Old Testament scriptures that display God’s salvation as a unilateral operation—where He acts solely based on His own character (His faith/faithfulness) and not on the cooperation of the human will.

### 1. Isaiah 48:9–11 (The "For My Own Sake" Argument)

This is arguably the strongest verse in the Bible regarding the _motive_ of salvation. It strips away any illusion that God saves us because he sees "potential" in us. He saves to protect His own reputation.

> _"For_ **_my name's sake_** _will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off... For mine own sake,_ **_even for mine own sake_**_, will I do it: for how should my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory unto another."_

- **The Operation of God:** God is saying, "If I destroy you, it makes Me look like I failed. So, I will save you—not because you are good, but because I am God."
    
- **The Type:** This foreshadows the Cross, where Jesus glorifies the Father. The work of redemption was ultimately to demonstrate the glory of God's grace (Ephesians 1:6).
    

### 2. Zechariah 3:1–4 (The "Joshua" Typology)

This is a visual courtroom scene that perfectly typifies the doctrine of Justification. Joshua the High Priest (representing the people) is standing before the Angel of the Lord (Pre-incarnate Christ) clothed in filthy garments. [[SATAN|Satan]] is accusing him.

**Crucial Detail:** Joshua says nothing. He does not apologize. He does not promise to do better. He just stands there.

> _"Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel. And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying,_ **_Take away the filthy garments from him_**_. And unto him he said, Behold,_ **_I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee_**_, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment."_

- **The Operation of God:** The removal of sin ("I have caused...") and the imputation of righteousness ("I will clothe thee...") are 100% the work of God. Joshua was passive. He was the _object_ of the operation, not a participant in it.
    

### 3. Deuteronomy 9:5–6 (The "Stiff-Necked" Reality)

God spoke this to Israel before they entered the Promised Land (a type of entering Salvation/Rest). He wanted to make sure they never took credit for the victory.

> _"Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land... Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness;_ **_for thou art a stiffnecked people_**_."_

- **The Operation of God:** God calls them "stiff-necked" (rebellious/stubborn) in the very same breath that He gives them the land. This proves the inheritance depends on the Giver's faithfulness, not the receiver's behavior.
    

### 4. Malachi 3:6 (The Immutable Guarantee)

This verse connects our survival directly to God’s unchanging nature (His faithfulness).

> _"For I am the LORD,_ **_I change not_**_; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed."_

- **The Operation of God:** The logic here is terrifying yet comforting. If God changed (i.e., if He reacted to our sins the way humans do), we would be consumed. The _only_ reason we are not destroyed is that His character is fixed. His "faith" to His own covenant is the only thing keeping us alive.
    

### 5. Psalm 89:30–34 (The Covenant That Cannot Fail)

This is a prophetic Psalm regarding the seed of David (Christ). It addresses the "What if?" question. What happens if the children of God fail?

> _"If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments... Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes. Nevertheless_ **_my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him_**_, nor suffer_ **_my faithfulness_** _to fail. My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips."_

- **The Operation of God:** This is the definition of "The Faith of God." He promises to discipline the sin, but He swears _never_ to remove the salvation (lovingkindness). Why? Because to do so would be to allow "His faithfulness to fail."
    
- **The Type:** This speaks of the New Covenant in Christ. Our behavior can bring discipline, but it cannot break the Covenant, because the Covenant is sustained by God's fidelity to His own Word, not our performance.
