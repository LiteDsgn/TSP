Here is the breakdown of the Hebraic perspective, the danger of stealing God's glory, and the practical purpose of our faith.

### 1. The Hebraic Perspective of Salvation

In Western/Greek thought, "salvation" is often abstract—an idea, a legal status, or "going to heaven." In Hebrew thought, it is concrete, physical, and action-oriented.

The Hebrew word for salvation is **Yeshua** (from the root _yasha_).

- **The Literal Meaning:** To be wide, spacious, or to develop freedom.
    
- **The Imagery:** It pictures someone who was confined in a tight, narrow space (danger/distress) being pulled out into a **wide, open space**.
    
- **The Implication:** A person in a tight pit cannot pull themselves out. They need an external hand.
    

**Exodus 14:13** captures the Hebraic definition perfectly. Moses tells the people at the Red Sea:

> _"Stand still, and see the_ **_salvation of the LORD_**_..."_

The Israelites did not fight. They did not swim. They did not help. They "stood still" (total passivity) and watched YHWH rip the sea apart (total divine activity). **In Hebrew thought, Salvation is exclusively the property of God.**

> _"Salvation belongeth unto the LORD..."_ (Psalm 3:8)_"The LORD is my light and my salvation..."_ (Psalm 27:1)

### 2. Is attributing belief to ourselves "Sharing in God’s Glory"?

**Yes.** If your theology is "God voted for me, the Devil voted against me, and I cast the tie-breaking vote," you have made yourself the savior. You have claimed that the difference between a saved person and a lost person is not God's grace, but your intelligence/willingness to choose.

If salvation is 99% God and 1% my "choice," then I have 1% to boast about in heaven.

**How to prove this is "Glory Stealing" (Scripture):**

**A. 1 Corinthians 1:29–31 (The "No Flesh" Rule)**Paul explains that God chose the foolish and weak specifically so that no human could claim credit.

> _"That_ **_no flesh should glory in his presence_**_. But of him are ye in Christ Jesus... He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord."_

- If your faith is of your own making, you can glory in your presence.
    

**B. John 1:12–13 (The Biological Argument)**John explicitly denies that the "will of man" causes the new birth.

> _"Which were born, not of blood,_ **_nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man_**_, but of God."_

- Just as you did not choose to be physically born (your parents did that work), you do not choose to be spiritually born. God is the Father; He decides when life begins.
    

**C. Romans 3:27 (The Exclusion of Boasting)**

> _"Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith."_

- If faith is something _we_ produce, it becomes a "work," and boasting is included. If faith is a gift _we receive_, boasting is excluded.
    

**D. Romans 11:35–36 (The Source)**

> _"Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again? For_ **_of him_**_, and_ **_through him_**_, and_ **_to him_**_, are all things: to whom be glory for ever."_

- If faith starts with you, then salvation is "of you." But the text says _all_ things (including the faith to believe) are "of Him."

### 3. If God does it all, what is our faith for?

If God is the Author and Finisher, why do we need to believe?

**A. Faith is the _Instrument_, not the _Cause_.**Imagine a starving man. Someone places a feast before him and puts a fork in his hand.

- The **Cause** of his life is the food and the generosity of the giver.
    
- The **Instrument** is the fork.
    
- **Our Faith is the fork.** It is merely the receiving mechanism. We do not look at the fork and say, "Thank you, fork, for feeding me." We use the fork to enjoy the food. Faith is the capacity to enjoy and experience what God has already done.
    

**B. Faith is for _Assurance_ and _[Communion](https://Communion.Faith)_[.](https://Communion.Faith)**[Faith](https://Communion.Faith) does not create the reality; it grabs hold of it.

- The sun is shining (Objective Truth).
    
- I open my blinds to see it (Subjective Faith).
    
- My opening the blinds did not turn the sun on. But if I keep the blinds closed, I remain in the dark _even though_ the sun is shining.
    
- Faith allows you to **experience** the peace, joy, and power of the salvation God has secured.
    

**C. What if our faith wavers?**Because salvation relies on God’s faith (fidelity), your wavering faith does not evict you from the family.

- **Scripture:** _"...If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful..."_ (2 Timothy 2:13).
    
- **Example:** When Peter was sinking in the water, his faith failed. But Jesus' hand did not fail. The grip of the Savior is stronger than the grip of the sinner.
    

**D. Does sin affect our salvation?**You must distinguish between **Relationship (Union)** and **Fellowship (Communion)**.

- **Relationship (Salvation):** This is legal and biological. You are a son. If a son commits a crime, he is a criminal son, but he is still a son. His DNA hasn't changed.
    

- _Scripture:_ Romans 8:38-39 (Nothing separates us from the love of God).
    

- **Fellowship (Walk):** Sin affects your _enjoyment_ of God, your conscience, and your usefulness. It brings God’s discipline (Hebrews 12:6 "For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth").
    

- _Scripture:_ Psalm 51. David lost the "joy" of his salvation when he sinned, but he did not ask God to restore his salvation—only the _joy_ of it.
    

**Summary:**Sin does not cost you your salvation because your salvation was bought by Christ’s blood, not your behavior. However, sin will cost you your peace, your rewards, and can bring the painful discipline of the Father.
