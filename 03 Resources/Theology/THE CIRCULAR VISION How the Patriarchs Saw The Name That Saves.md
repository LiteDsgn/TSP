# THE CIRCULAR VISION How the Patriarchs Saw The Name That Saves

#   

## Introduction: The Hebrew Worldview

Before we trace this through Abraham, Moses, David, and the prophets, we must understand the **Hebraic operating system** that these men shared:

**Hebrew thought is CONCRETE, not abstract.**

- Greeks asked: "What is the essence of a thing?"
    
- Hebrews asked: "What does the thing DO? How does it FUNCTION?"
    

**Hebrew thought is RELATIONAL, not individual.**

- Identity comes from CONNECTION, not isolation
    
- You are defined by whose son you are, whose tribe you belong to, whose God claims you
    

**Hebrew thought is COVENANTAL, not contractual.**

- A contract says: "If you perform, I'll pay"
    
- A covenant says: "You are mine. I have bound myself to you. Your failure doesn't cancel my oath."
    

With this foundation, let's trace the vision.

## ABRAHAM: The Covenant of the Name as SEED

### What Abraham Saw (Genesis 12-22)

When God appeared to Abram, He didn't give a philosophy lecture. He gave a **NAME-TRANSFER**:

**Genesis 17:5** — "No longer shall your name be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham, for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations."

### The Hebrew Philosophy Here:

**1. Name = Identity = Function**

- **Abram** (אַבְרָם) = "Exalted Father" (focused on status)
    
- **Abraham** (אַבְרָהָם) = "Father of Many" (focused on SEED/fruitfulness)
    

God wasn't just changing syllables; He was **inserting His own letter** (the "Hey" - ה) into Abraham's name. The "Hey" is the breath of God, the same letter that appears in **YHWH**.

**The Picture:** God was saying, "You can't fulfill this promise with your own strength (Abram). I am putting MY BREATH into your name so that nations will come out of you."

### The Collective Vision:

Abraham understood: **"I am not saved alone. I am saved AS a multitude."**

When God made the covenant in Genesis 15 (the torn animals), Abraham wasn't thinking, "How do I get to heaven?" He was thinking, "How will my SEED inherit the land? How will NATIONS come from my loins?"

**The Hebraic Mindset:** Salvation is GENERATIONAL and COMMUNAL.

- Abraham's faith wasn't about "me and God." It was about "my seed and God."
    
- When he offered Isaac (Genesis 22), he wasn't just trusting for himself—he was trusting that God would fulfill the COLLECTIVE promise even through death.
    

**Hebrews 11:19** confirms this: "Abraham reasoned that God could raise the dead." Why? Because **the promise was bigger than one life**. The Name (the Seed) had to continue.

### The Name as Seed:

Abraham saw the **NAME OF GOD** as a **SEED**:

- Just as his own name was changed to include God's breath (Hey)
    
- Just as his seed (Isaac) would carry the covenant
    
- So too, the ultimate **SEED** (singular, Galatians 3:16) would carry the **NAME** that saves all nations.
    

**Abraham's Circle:** "The Name of God → Plants itself in me (name change) → Produces Seed (Isaac/Christ) → That Seed multiplies into Nations (the Church) → So that ALL families of earth are blessed IN the Seed."

Abraham saw **Christ** as the fulfillment of the Collective Covenant (John 8:56 — "Abraham rejoiced to see my day").

---

## MOSES: The Covenant of the Name as PRESENCE

### What Moses Saw (Exodus 3, 33-34)

Moses' encounter at the Burning Bush was the **definition of the Name**, but his request in Exodus 33 revealed the **function of the Name**.

**Exodus 33:18** — "Show me your glory [[[KAVOD|Kavod]]]." **Exodus 33:19** — God replies: "I will make all my goodness pass before you, and **I will proclaim the name of YHWH** before you."

### The Hebrew Philosophy Here:

Moses asked for **Kavod** (Glory/Weight). God answered with **The Name**.

**This is the equation:** **Kavod = The Name = The Character of God in action**

When God "proclaimed the Name" in Exodus 34:6-7, He didn't say syllables. He **DESCRIBED HIS RELATIONAL NATURE**:

"YHWH, YHWH, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity..."

### The Collective Vision:

Moses understood: **"The Name is not INFORMATION about God; it is God's COMMITMENT to be present WITH His people."**

**Exodus 33:16** — Moses says: "Is it not in your GOING WITH US, so that we are distinct, I and your people, from every other people on the face of the earth?"

Moses wasn't asking for a theological download. He was asking: **"Will you GO with us?"**

### The Name as Presence:

The **Tabernacle** (Mishkan) is the architectural expression of this theology:

- **Mishkan** (מִשְׁכָּן) comes from **Shakan** (שָׁכַן) = "to dwell, to tabernacle"
    
- The same root appears in **Shekinah** = "The Dwelling Presence"
    

**John 1:14** — "The Word became flesh and **dwelt [eskenosen = tabernacled]** among us."

Moses saw the Tabernacle as the **BODY** where God's Name would dwell. Jesus is the **ULTIMATE BODY** where the Name dwells fully (Colossians 2:9).

### Moses' Circle:

"The Name ([[EHYEH|Ehyeh]]) → Promises Presence (I WILL BE with you) → Dwells in the Tabernacle (collective space) → Fulfilled in Christ (God with us) → Extended to the Church (you are the temple, 1 Cor 3:16) → So that God's Presence fills the WHOLE EARTH."

Moses saw the **Church as the Tabernacle of the Name**—the COLLECTIVE BODY where God's Presence manifests.

---

## DAVID: The Covenant of the Name as KINGDOM

### What David Saw (2 Samuel 7, Psalms)

David wanted to build God a **house** (temple). God reversed it:

**2 Samuel 7:11-13** — "The LORD will make you a **house**... I will raise up your offspring after you... and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever."

### The Hebrew Philosophy Here:

**[[BAYIT|Bayit]]** (בַּיִת) = House This word means BOTH:

- A physical building
    
- A family/dynasty
    

God was saying: "David, I don't need you to build me a building. I'm going to build YOU into a DYNASTY. Your SEED will be the eternal King."

### The Collective Vision:

David understood: **"The Name is connected to a KING who represents a KINGDOM."**

Look at **Psalm 22** (the Crucifixion Psalm):

- Verses 1-21: The suffering of the King ("My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?")
    
- Verses 22-31: The **RESULT** — "All the ends of the earth shall **remember and turn** to YHWH... A Seed shall serve him... they shall come and **declare his righteousness** to a people yet unborn."
    

David saw: **The King suffers alone → So that the KINGDOM is born.**

### The Name as Kingdom:

David understood that the **Name** = the **Authority/Reign** of God made visible through a King.

**Psalm 20:7** — "Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in **the name of YHWH our God**."

This isn't magical incantation. It's **covenant confidence**: "We trust that the King who carries God's Name will save us."

### David's Circle:

"The Name (Authority) → Established in a King (David/Christ) → The King suffers and dies (Psalm 22) → The Kingdom is born from His death → That Kingdom extends to ALL NATIONS → So that a Seed (the Church) serves Him forever."

David saw the **Church as the Kingdom of the Name**—the COLLECTIVE RULE of God manifested through the suffering and exaltation of the King.

## ISAIAH: The Covenant of the Name as SERVANT

### What Isaiah Saw (Isaiah 40-66, especially 52-53)

Isaiah had the most **scandalous** vision: The Name of God would be carried by a **SERVANT** who suffers.

**Isaiah 52:13** — "Behold, my servant shall act wisely; he shall be high and lifted up..." **Isaiah 53:10** — "It was the will of YHWH to crush him... when his soul makes an offering for guilt, **he shall see his offspring [SEED]**."

### The Hebrew Philosophy Here:

The word for **Servant** = **[[EVED|Eved]]** (עֶבֶד)

- Paleo-Hebrew: **Ayin** (Eye/See) + **Bet** (House) + **Dalet** (Door)
    
- **Picture:** One who SEES the needs of the HOUSE and opens the DOOR
    

The Servant isn't weak; the Servant is the **FUNCTIONAL PRESENCE** of the Master.

### The Collective Vision:

Isaiah saw something SHOCKING: **"The Servant suffers ALONE, but the result is COLLECTIVE salvation."**

**Isaiah 53:11** — "By his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant, make **many** to be accounted righteous."

**Isaiah 53:12** — "He [[BORE|bore]] the sin of **many**."

Isaiah understood: **One dies → Many live.** This is the arithmetic of the covenant.

### The Name as Servant:

The **Servant Songs** (Isaiah 42, 49, 50, 52-53) describe a figure who:

1. **Carries the Name** — Isaiah 49:3, "You are my servant, Israel, in whom I will be glorified"
    
2. **Restores the Name** — Isaiah 49:6, "I will make you as a light for the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth"
    
3. **Dies for the Name** — Isaiah 53:10, His soul becomes an **asham** (guilt offering)
    

Isaiah saw: **The Name of God would be VINDICATED through the suffering of the Servant.**

### Isaiah's Circle:

"The Name (Glory/Kavod) → Humbled in a Servant (Isaiah 53) → The Servant is crushed alone → His suffering PURCHASES many → Those many become His SEED (offspring) → That Seed becomes a LIGHT TO NATIONS → So that God's salvation reaches the ends of the earth."

Isaiah saw the **Church as the Offspring of the Servant**—the COLLECTIVE FRUIT of the Suffering One's sacrifice.

---

## JEREMIAH: The Covenant of the Name as WRITTEN INTERNALLY

### What Jeremiah Saw (Jeremiah 31)

Jeremiah saw the **NEW COVENANT**:

**Jeremiah 31:31-34** — "Behold, the days are coming, declares YHWH, when I will make a **new covenant**... I will put my law **within them**, and I will write it **on their hearts**... And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor... saying, 'Know YHWH,' for **they shall all know me**."

### The Hebrew Philosophy Here:

The word **[[KARATH|Karath]]** (כָּרַת) = "to cut covenant"

- Literal meaning: "to cut" (as in cutting animals in Genesis 15)
    
- Implies: **bloodshed, binding, irreversible union**
    

The NEW covenant isn't just a fresh start—it's a DEEPER CUT.

The word **[[YADAH|Yadah]]** (יָדַע) = "to know"

- Not intellectual knowledge
    
- **Intimate, experiential, relational knowing** (the same word used for sexual intimacy in Genesis 4:1)
    

### The Collective Vision:

Jeremiah understood: **"The Name will no longer be EXTERNAL (written on stone tablets) but INTERNAL (written on hearts)."**

This is COLLECTIVE transformation:

- **"They shall ALL know me, from the least to the greatest"** — No hierarchy. Universal access.
    
- **"I will be their God, and they shall be my people"** — Collective identity.
    

### The Name as Internal Reality:

Jeremiah saw that the **Name** would shift from:

- **EXTERNAL SIGN** (the Law carved in stone)
    
- to **INTERNAL PRESENCE** (the Spirit writing on hearts)
    

**Ezekiel 36:26-27** adds clarity: "I will give you a new heart... And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes."

The **Spirit** is the AGENT that writes the Name internally.

### Jeremiah's Circle:

"The Name (Covenant) → Externally given at Sinai (stone tablets) → Broken by human failure → NEW Covenant announced (Jeremiah 31) → The Spirit writes the Name on hearts (Ezekiel 36) → Fulfilled in Christ's blood and Spirit (Luke 22:20, Acts 2) → So that ALL (collectively) KNOW God intimately."

Jeremiah saw the **Church as the Living Tablets of the Name**—the COLLECTIVE embodiment of God's internal law.

## THE SYNTHESIS: The Hebraic Circle of the Name

Now let's bring them ALL together and show how each patriarch saw **ONE COHERENT VISION** from different angles:

### The Complete Circle (Their Collective Vision):

**1. ABRAHAM** saw the Name as **SEED**:

- "In your Seed, all nations will be blessed" (Genesis 22:18)
    
- The Name PLANTS itself → MULTIPLIES → COVERS the earth
    

**2. MOSES** saw the Name as **PRESENCE**:

- "I WILL BE with you" (Exodus 3:12)
    
- The Name DWELLS → TABERNACLES → FILLS the people
    

**3. DAVID** saw the Name as **KINGDOM**:

- "Your throne shall be established forever" (2 Samuel 7:16)
    
- The Name REIGNS → RULES → EXTENDS through a King
    

**4. ISAIAH** saw the Name as **SERVANT**:

- "By his knowledge shall many be accounted righteous" (Isaiah 53:11)
    
- The Name SUFFERS → DIES → BIRTHS offspring
    

**5. JEREMIAH** saw the Name as **INTERNAL COVENANT**:

- "I will write it on their hearts" (Jeremiah 31:33)
    
- The Name is EXTERNAL → BECOMES INTERNAL → TRANSFORMS from within

## THE UNIFIED PICTURE: How They All Saw Christ and the Church

### Here's the stunning part:

**EACH** of these men saw **TWO REALITIES simultaneously**:

1. **The Name Embodied in ONE** (The Messiah/Christ)
    
2. **The Name Extended to MANY** (The Seed/Church)
    

Let me show you how they would have articulated it:

---

### **ABRAHAM's Version:**

"The Name of God will come as a **SEED**. That Seed will die (Isaac on the altar), but God will raise him. From that ONE SEED will come a multitude—Jews and Gentiles—all called by the Name. We are not many seeds; we are ONE SEED (Christ), and in Him, we become the many."

**Galatians 3:16, 29** — "Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, 'And to offsprings,' referring to many, but referring to one, 'And to your offspring,' who is Christ... And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring."

---

### **MOSES' Version:**

"The Name of God will **DWELL** among us. First, He will tabernacle in a tent of skins and curtains. But one day, the Name will tabernacle in FLESH (John 1:14). And after that, the Name will tabernacle in US—His people will become living stones, a spiritual house (1 Peter 2:5). The PRESENCE of God will not be confined to one building; it will fill the WHOLE EARTH through His people."

**Exodus 29:45-46** — "I will dwell among the people of Israel and will be their God. And they shall know that I am YHWH their God, who brought them out... that I might dwell among them."

---

### **DAVID's Version:**

"The Name of God will establish a **KINGDOM**. That Kingdom will come through a KING from my line. That King will suffer and die (Psalm 22), but His death will not end the Kingdom—it will BIRTH the Kingdom. From His death, a SEED will arise to serve Him. That Seed is us—the Church—the Kingdom of priests who declare His righteousness to every generation."

**Revelation 1:5-6** — "To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father, to him be glory and dominion forever."

---

### **ISAIAH's Version:**

"The Name of God will be carried by a **SERVANT** who will be crushed. He will bear the sin of MANY. But when He dies, He will SEE His offspring (Isaiah 53:10). That offspring is the Church. We are the FRUIT of His suffering. He died ALONE so that we could be MANY. He was 'numbered with the transgressors' so that we could be 'numbered with the righteous.'"

**Isaiah 53:11-12** — "Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied; by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant, make many to be accounted righteous... because he poured out his soul to death."

---

### **JEREMIAH's Version:**

"The Name of God will be written on our HEARTS. The old covenant was external—written on stone, obeyed by effort. The new covenant is internal—written by the Spirit, lived by grace. We won't need to teach each other 'Know the Lord,' because we will ALL know Him—from the least to the greatest. This isn't individualism; this is COLLECTIVE TRANSFORMATION. The whole Body will carry the Name internally."

**Hebrews 8:10-11** — "For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel... I will put my laws into their minds, and write them on their hearts... And they shall not teach, each one his neighbor... for they shall all know me."

---

## THE FULL CIRCLE: The Name That Became Us

Here's the **COMPLETE HEBRAIC VISION** that all the patriarchs and prophets saw:

### **Phase 1: The Name Promised** (Abraham)

- God puts His breath (Hey) into Abraham's name
    
- The Name becomes SEED—destined to multiply
    

### **Phase 2: The Name Present** (Moses)

- God reveals the Name at the Bush: "I WILL BE"
    
- The Name dwells in the Tabernacle—promising future embodiment
    

### **Phase 3: The Name Reigning** (David)

- God establishes the Name through a King
    
- The King will suffer (Psalm 22) but His throne will be eternal
    

### **Phase 4: The Name Suffering** (Isaiah)

- God humbles the Name in a Servant
    
- The Servant dies ALONE → to birth MANY (His offspring)
    

### **Phase 5: The Name Internalized** (Jeremiah/Ezekiel)

- God writes the Name on HEARTS
    
- The Spirit transforms the COLLECTIVE from within
    

### **Phase 6: The Name Incarnate** (John 1:14)

- "The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us"
    
- Jesus is the fulfillment: The Seed, The Presence, The King, The Servant, The Living Covenant
    

### **Phase 7: The Name Extended** (Acts 2, Ephesians)

- The Spirit is poured out at Pentecost
    
- The Church becomes the BODY of Christ—the living extension of the Name
    
- "As He is, so are we in this world" (1 John 4:17)
    

---

## YOUR GOAL: "That We Might Be ONE"

You said:

> "I WANT TO SEE US (THE NAME THAT IS CALLED GOD = YOU + I) THAT WE MIGHT BE ONE AS MANIFESTED UNTO US IN CHRIST JESUS..."

Here's the **Hebraic explanation**:

The patriarchs and prophets ALL saw this:

**The Name of God is not a LABEL—it is a RELATIONAL REALITY that INCLUDES us.**

- When God said "I WILL BE," He was saying, "I will BE _with you_, _in you_, _for you_."
    
- When Jesus prayed "that they may be ONE as we are one" (John 17:21), He was saying, "I want them to be INSIDE the Name—inside the Ehyeh-[[ASHER|Asher]]-Ehyeh flow."
    

### The Hebraic Formula:

**YHWH (The Name) = The Collective Relationship between God and His People**

- We are not OUTSIDE the Name, shouting at it
    
- We are INSIDE the Name, participating in it
    
- The Church is the BODY that bears the Name
    

**Isaiah 43:7** — "Everyone who is **called by my name**, whom I created for my glory."

**Acts 15:14** — "God... visited the Gentiles, to take from them **a people for his name**."

**James 2:7** — "Is it not they who blaspheme **the honorable name by which you were called**?"

---

## FINAL SYNTHESIS: The Patriarchs' Unified Vision

If you gathered Abraham, Moses, David, Isaiah, and Jeremiah in a room and asked them, **"What is the Name of God?"** here's what they would say:

**ABRAHAM:** "The Name is a SEED. It starts small (in me), but it will fill the earth (through my offspring). That Seed is Christ, and all who are in Him share the Name."

**MOSES:** "The Name is PRESENCE. God will not stay distant. He will DWELL with us—first in a tent, then in flesh, then in US. We are His Tabernacle."

**DAVID:** "The Name is a KINGDOM. God will rule through a King who suffers and reigns. That King is Christ, and we are His Kingdom—royal priests who extend His reign."

**ISAIAH:** "The Name is a SERVANT. God will humble Himself, bear our sins, and die alone. But from His death, MANY will be born. We are His offspring—the fruit of His suffering."

**JEREMIAH:** "The Name is INTERNAL. God will write His covenant on our hearts. We won't just KNOW ABOUT Him; we will KNOW Him intimately. The whole Body will carry the Name within."

---

## Conclusion: The Circle Closes

Here's the **complete circle** they all saw:

1. **The Name is PROMISED** (Abraham's Seed)
    
2. **The Name is REVEALED** (Moses' Ehyeh)
    
3. **The Name is ENTHRONED** (David's King)
    
4. **The Name is CRUCIFIED** (Isaiah's Servant)
    
5. **The Name is INTERNALIZED** (Jeremiah's New Covenant)
    
6. **The Name is INCARNATE** (John's Word made Flesh)
    
7. **The Name is US** (The Church—the collective manifestation)
    

**The Hebraic vision is this:**

God's Name is not a WORD you say—it's a REALITY you PARTICIPATE IN.

When you are baptized "in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit," you are not getting wet while someone says magic words. You are being **IMMERSED INTO THE RELATIONAL FLOW** of the Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh.

You are becoming part of the SEED (Abraham), the TEMPLE (Moses), the KINGDOM (David), the OFFSPRING (Isaiah), the LIVING TABLETS (Jeremiah)—**the COLLECTIVE BODY that bears the Name of God.**

This is why Paul can say:

**Philippians 2:9-11** — "God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him **the name that is above every name**, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow... and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord."

And why John can say:

**1 John 3:1** — "See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be **called children of God**; and so we are."

**WE ARE CALLED BY THE NAME.**

And therefore, **as He is, so are we in this world.**

---

**The patriarchs saw it. The prophets saw it. Jesus fulfilled it. The Spirit applies it. The Church embodies it.**

**The Name became Flesh. The Flesh became Us. We are One.**
