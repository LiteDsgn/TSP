# The Collective Covenant

This is where your theology becomes structurally unshakeable. When you look at the nature of Covenants and then read **John 17** through the lens of _Ehyeh_ (I WILL BE) and _Kavod_ (Glory), it solves the riddle of how Jesus views salvation.

Here is the breakdown.

---

### 1. Is the Covenant Individual or Collective?

**The Covenant is fundamentally Collective.**

In the modern West, we view salvation as "Me and Jesus." But in Hebraic thought, God makes covenants with a **Head** that covers a **Body**.

- **[[ADAM|Adam]]:** The covenant was with _Man_ (Collective). When Adam fell, everyone "in him" fell.
    
- **Abraham:** God didn't just promise Abraham a son; He promised him "nations." To be in the covenant, you just had to be born into the tribe.
    
- **David:** The covenant was for the "Kingdom" (Collective).
    

**The Switch:**Salvation is **Collective in its Scope**, but **Individual in its Realization.**

- **The Scope:** When Jesus died, He died as the "Last Adam" (1 Corinthians 15:45). He represented the entire human race. He reconciled the **World** (Collective).
    
- **The Realization:** Faith is when the **Individual** realizes they are part of the **Collective** reality.
    

**Why this matters for your theology:**It supports **Objective Reconciliation**. If the First Adam could condemn you without your permission (Collective), the Last Adam (Jesus) can save you without your permission (Collective). Your "faith" is simply waking up to the fact that you have been moved into a new Tribe.

### 2. Connecting Your Theology to John 17

John 17 is the "Holy of Holies" of the New Testament. It is the conversation between the **First [[EHYEH|Ehyeh]]** (Father/Source) and the **Second Ehyeh** (Son/Manifestation).

Here is how your specific points appear in Jesus' prayer:

#### A. The Name as Relationship, Not Data (John 17:6, 26)

> _"I have manifested_ **_thy name_** _unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world..."_ (v.6)_"And I have declared unto them_ **_thy name_**_, and will declare it:_ **_that the love_** _wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them..."_ (v.26)

- **Your Theology:** The Name is _Ehyeh_ (I WILL BE / I AM BECOMING).
    
- **The Connection:** Jesus did not walk around pronouncing the syllables "YHWH." He "manifested" the Name by **being** the nature of God in flesh.
    
- **The _Asher_ Link:** In verse 26, Jesus links **The Name** directly to **The Love**. He confirms that knowing the Name isn't about theology; it's about being inserted into the relationship ("that the love... may be in them").
    

#### B. The Faith of God (Monergism) (John 17:2, 6, 9)

> _"As thou hast_ **_given him_** _power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as_ **_thou hast given him_**_."_ (v.2)_"I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which_ **_thou hast given me_**_; for_ **_they are thine_**_."_ (v.9)

- **Your Theology:** Salvation is God's operation, sustained by His faithfulness.
    
- **The Connection:** Notice the passivity of the believers. They are described as gifts passed from Father to Son. They didn't "give themselves" to Jesus; the Father gave them.
    
- **Security:** If you gave yourself to Jesus, you could take yourself back. But if the Father gave you to Jesus, only the Father can take you back. And Jesus says, _"Those that thou gavest me I have kept, and_ **_none of them is lost_**_"_ (v.12).
    

#### C. _Yesh_ vs. _Kavod_ (John 17:5, 22)

> _"And now, O Father,_ **_glorify_** _thou me... with the_ **_glory_** _[[[KAVOD|Kavod]]] which I had with thee before the world was."_ (v.5)_"And the_ **_glory_** _[Kavod] which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one."_ (v.22)

- **Your Theology:** _Yesh_ is existence/substance; _Kavod_ is the weighty manifestation of that reality.
    
- **The Connection:**
    

- **The _Yesh_:** Jesus and the believers already have "being" and "existence" in the Father.
    
- **The Prayer:** Jesus is praying for the **Kavod**. He is praying that the _weight_ of who He is will land on them.
    
- **The result:** When believers receive this _Kavod_, they become "One." The Glory is the glue. It is the visible evidence of the invisible reality.
    

#### D. The "[[ASHER|Asher]]" (The Bridge of Oneness) (John 17:21, 23)

> _"That they all may be one;_ **_as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee_**_, that they also may be one_ **_in us_**_..."_ (v.21)_"I in them, and thou in me..."_ (v.23)

- **Your Theology:** _Ehyeh_ — **Asher** — _Ehyeh_. The middle term is the Connector/Bridge.
    
- **The Connection:** Jesus is describing the **Asher** dynamic.
    

- The Father is in the Son.
    
- The Son is in the Believer.
    
- Therefore, the Believer is sucked into the divine flow of the "I AM."
    

- **The Goal:** Jesus wants the world to know that **we are part of the "I AM" event.** We are not just watching God; we are inside the movement of God.
    

#### E. Objective Reality / Pre-Existence (John 17:24)

> _"Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am... for thou lovedst me_ **_before the foundation of the world_**_."_

- **Your Theology:** Salvation is an ancient reality we wake up to.
    
- **The Connection:** The love relationship didn't start at the Cross; it started "before the foundation of the world." The Cross was the _manifestation_ of the ancient love, not the _invention_ of it.
    
- **Faith as Awakening:** Jesus prays that we "be with Him where He is." Spiritually, we are already there (Ephesians 2:6). He is praying for our **conscious realization** (beholding His glory) of where we actually stand.
    

### Summary of John 17 through your lens:

John 17 is the **Second Ehyeh** (Jesus) reporting back to the **First Ehyeh** (Father) that the mission is accomplished:

1. He has **manifested the Name** (made the "I WILL BE" into "I AM HERE").
    
2. He has **secured the Collective** (those given to Him).
    
3. He has **transferred the Kavod** (given them the weight/glory of sonship).
    
4. He is asking that they **fully realize** (behold) the love that has held them since before time began.
