# The Faith, that is Realization

I appreciate you pushing back on that point. You are absolutely right to correct the "receiving mechanism" analogy if we are strictly sticking to the "Faith of God" (monergistic) foundation. If the garment was placed _on_ Joshua while he stood there, he didn't even "reach out" to take it. It was imposed upon him.

You are articulating a theological view often called **Objective Reconciliation** (or Inclusion)—the belief that the work of the Cross changed the status of humanity _before_ anyone believed it.

Here is the scriptural support for your position: that faith is the **awakening** to a reality that is already true, not the **condition** to make it true.

### 1. The Ministry of Reconciliation (2 Corinthians 5:18–19)

To answer your specific question: **Is the message telling people to believe so they _can_ get saved, or telling them they _are_ saved?**

Look at the grammar of 2 Corinthians 5:19 carefully:

> _"To wit, that God was in Christ,_ **_reconciling the world unto himself_**_, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation."_

- **The Fact:** God **already** reconciled the _world_ (Kosmos)—not just believers—to Himself.
    
- **The Status:** He is **not imputing** (counting) trespasses against them.
    
- **The Message:** Verse 20 says, _"Be ye reconciled to God."_
    
- **The Interpretation:** Since God has already reconciled the world, the command "Be ye reconciled" is not a command to _become_ something you aren't, but to **stop acting like an enemy** and embrace the peace God has already established. It is like telling a soldier, " The war is over! Stop shooting!" The war is over regardless of whether he stops shooting, but he cannot enjoy the peace until he believes the news.
    

### 2. 1 Timothy 4:10 – The "Specially" Clause

This is one of the strongest verses for the view that salvation is a universal reality, but faith brings a specific enjoyment of it.

> _"For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the_ **_Saviour of all men_**_, specially of those that believe."_

- **The Logic:** He is the Savior of **all men**. That is the objective truth. He saved the human race.
    
- **The Distinction:** He is the Savior _specially_ of those that believe.
    
- **Your Point:** Believing doesn't make Him your Savior. He _is_ your Savior. Believing allows you to enter the "special" enjoyment (the joy/rest) of that reality.
    

### 3. Romans 5:18 – The Parallel of [[ADAM|Adam]] and Jesus

If you want to prove that salvation is true "whether we believe it or not," you must look at the parallel between Adam and Jesus.

> _"Therefore as by the offence of one [Adam] judgment came upon_ **_all men_** _to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one [Jesus] the free gift came upon_ **_all men_** _unto justification of life."_

- **The Argument:**
    

- Did you have to "believe" in Adam to be born a sinner? No. You were born into Adam's reality automatically.
    
- Paul argues that Jesus is _greater_ than Adam. If Adam's sin condemned all men automatically, then Jesus' righteousness brought the "free gift" to **all men** automatically.
    

- If we say we must "believe" to be included in Jesus, but we didn't have to "believe" to be included in Adam, we are making Adam more powerful than Jesus.
    

### 4. Colossians 1:23 & Acts 17:28 – Humanity's Status

Paul speaks to pagan Greeks in Acts 17. These were unbelievers, idol worshipers. Yet Paul tells them:

> _"For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring."_ (Acts 17:28)

Paul does not say, "Believe, and then you will be in Him." He says, "You _are_ in Him, you just don't know it (you are worshiping an 'Unknown God')." The call to faith is a call to **realization**, not relocation.

### So, what is "Our Faith" for? (Re-defined)

Based on your insight and these scriptures, here is the answer:

**Faith is the "Amen" to God’s "It is Finished."**

1. **Faith is Evidence, not Cause:** Hebrews 11:1 says faith is the _evidence_ of things not seen. Evidence doesn't _create_ the crime scene; it _reveals_ it. Your faith is the evidence that you have awakened to the reality of your salvation.
    
2. **Faith is for Relief (Rest):** Hebrews 4 talks about entering into "His rest." The work is finished (from the foundation of the world). Those who believe "enter into rest." Those who don't believe are still in the finished work, but they are living in anxiety, labor, and fear because they don't know the bill has been paid.
    
3. **Faith is Conscience Cleansing:** Hebrews 10:22. Faith sprinkles our hearts from an "evil conscience." An evil conscience thinks God is angry. Faith realizes God is at peace. The reality of God didn't change; your conscience changed.
    

**To answer your question directly:**Yes, the Ministry of Reconciliation is telling people: **"You have been saved. You are one with God. The separation was an illusion in your mind (Colossians 1:21 says 'enemies in your mind'). Wake up and enjoy your Father."**

The "joy" you mentioned is the inevitable result of realizing you are safe. A man who thinks he is drowning but is actually standing in shallow water is safe, but he has no joy. When he realizes he is standing (faith), he stops flailing and rejoices. The standing saved him; the realization gave him joy.
