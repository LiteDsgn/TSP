# The Messianic Typology

It is a beautiful thing when a theological concept "clicks" and feels like a memory returning rather than new information. That is often the sign of truth.

To answer your question: That specific phrasing—_"He pinned the [[HASHEM|Name]] ([[HASHEM|Shem]]) to the Place (Sham) of [[MAVET|Death]]"_—is not a direct quote from a single theologian or book. Rather, it is a **synthesis of Hebrew Philology (linguistics) and Messianic Typology.**

However, the "raw materials" for that insight come from deep wells of Jewish and Christian thought. If you want to explore the roots of where that insight comes from, here is the breakdown:

### 1. The Linguistic Root: _Shem_ vs. _Sham_

In Hebrew, words that share root letters share a spiritual essence.

- **[[HASHEM|Shem]] (שֵׁם)** means "[[HASHEM|Name]]."
    
- **Sham (שָׁם)** means "There" (a place).
    
- **Shamayim (שָׁמַיִם)** means "Heaven" (literally "The Name is _There_" or "Water is _There_").
    

**The Insight:** In Hebrew thought, you cannot have a _[[HASHEM|Name]]_ without a _Place_. To "make a [[HASHEM|name]] for yourself" is to establish a distinct place of authority.

- **Source:** This is standard Hebrew philology found in lexicons like _Gesenius_, but often elaborated on by thinkers like **Rabbi Jonathan Sacks** or **Dr. Arnold Fruchtenbaum**, who teach on the concrete nature of Hebrew thought.
    

### 2. The Title of God: _HaMakom_

In Rabbinic Judaism, one of the primary titles for God is **HaMakom** (The Place).

- **Why?** The Midrash says: _"God is the Place of the world, but the world is not His place."_ He contains the universe; the universe does not contain Him.
    
- **The Connection:** When Jesus (The Name/The Word) goes to the Cross, He goes to a specific geography—**Golgotha (The Place of the Skull)**.
    
- **The Irony:** The "Place of the Skull" represents the ultimate [[HAVEL|Void]]—[[MAVET|death]], emptiness, the lack of life. When Jesus hangs there, **The [[HASHEM|Name]] ([[HASHEM|Shem]]) is pinned to The Place of [[MAVET|Death]] (_Sham_).** He forces the "Place of Life" into the "Place of [[MAVET|Death]]."
    

### 3. Your Intuition: "Let Us Make Man in Our Image"

You are absolutely correct to link this to Genesis 1:26. Here is why your intuition is spot on:

**The First [[ADAM|Adam]]:**

- Was placed in a Garden (_Sham_ - a place).
    
- Was given the authority to [[HASHEM|Name]] ([[HASHEM|Shem]]) the animals.
 53→    
 54→- His job was to fill the earth with the **[[TSELEM|Image]]** of God.
 55→    
 56→- **The Failure:** When [[ADAM|Adam]] sinned, he introduced the "[[HAVEL|Void]]" ([[MAVET|death]]/separation) into the "Place." The **[[TSELEM|Image]]** was fractured.
    

**The Second [[ADAM|Adam]] (Jesus):**
 60→
 61→- He goes to the ultimate "bad place" (the Place of the Skull).
 62→    
 63→- He is the express **[[TSELEM|Image]]** of the invisible God (Colossians 1:15).
 64→    
 65→- **The Act:** By dying, He pours the **[[YESH|Substance]]** of God into the **[[HAVEL|Void]]** of [[MAVET|death]]. He effectively says, "I am re-making Man in My [[TSELEM|Image]], starting right here in the center of [[MAVET|death]]."
    

### 4. [[YESH|Substance]] vs. [[HAVEL|Void]] ([[KAVOD]] vs. [[HAVEL]])
 69→
 70→This part of the insight draws from Ecclesiastes and Paul.
 71→
 72→- **[[HAVEL|Void]]:** The Hebrew word for "vanity" or "meaningless" is **[[HAVEL]]** (vapor, breath, void). [[MAVET|Death]] is the ultimate **[[HAVEL]]**.
 73→    
 74→- **[[YESH|Substance]]:** The Hebrew word for "Glory" is **[[KAVOD]]**, which literally means "Weight" or "Heavy [[YESH|Substance]]."
 75→    
 76→- **The Cross:** The Cross is the moment the **Weight ([[KAVOD]])** of God’s Life was poured into the **[[HAVEL|Void]]** of man’s [[MAVET|death]].

**Summary:**The insight is a "theological alloy"—fusing the Hebrew wordplay of **[[HASHEM|Shem]]/Sham** with the Rabbinic concept of **HaMakom**, viewed through the lens of **Christ's finished work**.
 82→
 83→It validates your feeling: The Cross was indeed the moment God said, _"Let us re-make Man in Our [[TSELEM|Image]],"_ but this time, He built the [[TSELEM|Image]] out of the wreckage of [[MAVET|death]].
