# The Name That Saves An Awakening to the Reality of God

Here is a dissertation reflecting your theological perspective. It weaves together the Monergistic work of God, the revelation of the Name (_Ehyeh_), the Hebrew concepts of _Yesh_ and _Kavod_, and the understanding of faith as a joyful awakening.

**A Dissertation on the Unilateral Faithfulness of the "I AM"**

### Introduction: Beyond the Transaction

For centuries, much of Western theology has approached salvation as a transaction: a negotiation between a reluctant Deity and a desperate sinner, mediated by the currency of human belief. In this view, God provides the possibility, but man provides the permission. However, when we strip away Greek philosophy and return to the Hebraic roots of Scripture, a far more glorious picture emerges. Salvation is not a contract signed by human will; it is a unilateral covenant sustained by Divine character. It is not man finding God; it is the "I AM" becoming the event of our rescue.

To understand salvation, we must stop looking at the quality of our faith and start looking at the nature of His Name.

### Part I: The Theology of the Name ([[EHYEH|Ehyeh]])

Everything begins at the Burning Bush. When Moses asked for the identity of the Voice in the fire, he did not receive a static definition. He received a promise. God replied, **"Ehyeh [[ASHER|asher]] Ehyeh"** (Exodus 3:14).

Traditionally translated "I AM WHO I AM," the Hebrew imperfect tense implies dynamic movement: **"I WILL BE WHAT I WILL BE."** God was not defining His existence; He was declaring His intent. He was saying, "I will happen. I will become what is necessary."

This reveals the triune architecture of salvation:

1. **The Source (The First Ehyeh):** The Father, the hidden "I WILL BE."
    
2. **The Bridge (The Asher):** The Spirit, the relational connector.
    
3. **The Manifestation (The Second Ehyeh):** The Son, the visible "I AM."
    

This was not just a name; it was a prophecy of the Incarnation. The God who said "I WILL BE" in Exodus eventually "BECAME" in John 1:14 (_"And the Word_ **_became_** _flesh..."_). As Jesus declared in **John 8:58**, _"Before Abraham was, I am."_ He is the fulfillment of the burning bush—the distant Fire becoming the touchable Man.

Therefore, salvation does not begin with our decision. It began with His definition. He exists to save.

### Part II: The Faith of God (Monergism)

If God’s name implies an active movement toward humanity, then the mechanism of salvation must be **His faithfulness**, not ours. This is the "Faith of God."

Scripture is clear that salvation is a rescue operation for the dead, not a partnership with the living. **Isaiah 59:16** paints the picture: _"And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained him."_

When humanity was spiritually bankrupt, God did not wait for a partner. He acted alone.

- **2 Timothy 2:13** declares, _"If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself."_
    
- **Isaiah 48:9-11** reveals His motive: _"For_ **_my name's sake_** _will I defer mine anger... for how should my name be polluted?"_
    

Salvation is God protecting His own reputation. He calls Himself "The God of Jacob" (the deceiver). If He were to abandon Jacob due to Jacob’s failure, God would be falsifying His own Name. Our security lies not in our behavior, but in God’s refusal to be a liar. We are saved by the **faith of the operation of God** (Colossians 2:12), the energy of the Creator resurrecting the dead.

### Part III: The Reality of Being ([[YESH|Yesh]])

If God does the work alone, what is the status of humanity? Here we must embrace the truth of **Objective Reconciliation**.

Paul writes in **2 Corinthians 5:19**, _"God was in Christ, reconciling the_ **_world_** _unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them."_ The work is finished. The "Group Chat" of humanity has been re-connected to the Server of Life, whether the participants are active or lurking.

In Hebrew thought, this is the concept of **Yesh** (Existence/Substance). To be in covenant with Wisdom is to inherit _Yesh_ (Proverbs 8:21).

- **Acts 17:28** confirms this universal reality: _"For_ **_in him_** _we live, and move, and have our being."_
    
- **Romans 5:18** draws the parallel: Just as [[ADAM|Adam]]’s sin condemned all men without their consent, Christ’s act of righteousness brought the "free gift" to **all men** without their contribution.
    

The sinner is not separated from God by distance; they are separated by **alienation in the mind** (Colossians 1:21). They are like the Prodigal Son in the pig pen—he was still a son (that is the _Yesh_/Reality), but he was suffering as if he were an orphan. He did not need to _become_ a son; he needed to _wake up_ to his sonship.

### Part IV: Faith as Joyful Awakening ([[KAVOD|Kavod]])

If the work is finished and the reality (_Yesh_) is established, what then is the purpose of our faith?

Faith is not the purchase price of salvation; faith is the **"Amen"** to a prayer God has already answered. Faith is the transition from _Yesh_ (Existence) to **Kavod** (Glory/Weight).

- **Isaiah 44:22** reverses the religious order of operations: _"Return unto me;_ **_for_** _I have redeemed thee."_ We do not repent to _get_ redeemed; we return because we _are_ redeemed.
    
- **Leviticus 25** provides the imagery of the Jubilee. When the trumpet sounded on the Day of Atonement, the slaves were legally free. A slave in the field who believed the trumpet dropped his hoe and danced. A slave who didn't believe the trumpet kept working. Both were free, but only one enjoyed the **Kavod**—the heavy, glorious weight of liberty.
    

This is the purpose of the Ministry of Reconciliation. We are not telling men, "Do this and God will love you." We are announcing, "You are loved. You are known. You are named. Wake up!"

Faith is **"Remembering."** As **Psalm 22:27** prophesies, _"All the ends of the world shall_ **_remember_** _and turn unto the LORD."_ You can only remember what you once knew. Faith is the soul recovering the memory of its origin in God.

### Conclusion: Living the Name

We have moved from the dry ground of transactional religion to the ocean of relational reality.

1. **The Name:** God is the "I WILL BE" (_Ehyeh_), the Event that saves.
    
2. **The Work:** It is finished by His arm alone (Monergism).
    
3. **The Status:** We are reconciled, held in His existence (_Yesh_).
    
4. **The Response:** We believe, we awake, and we manifest His glory (_Kavod_).
    

Therefore, the Christian life is not an attempt to reach heaven. It is the realization that the "I AM" has reached us. As **Colossians 1:27** states, it is _"Christ in you, the hope of glory."_

We do not shout His name to get His attention; we whisper "Abba" because we already have His heart. We are the burning bushes of this generation—ordinary vessels aflame with a Presence that does not consume us, but defines us.

You are not just a believer. You are **"called by His Name"** (Isaiah 43:7). You are the visible proof that the _Ehyeh_ has kept His promise.

_Go and live as the dwelling place of the I AM._
