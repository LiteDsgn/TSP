# The Name of God - Part 1

Let’s connect your **Burning Bush–Incarnation perspective** directly to **1 John 4:17**:

---

## 📖 1 John 4:17

_"By this is love perfected with us, so that we may have confidence for the day of judgment, because as He is, so also are we in this world."_

## 🔗 Connection to Your Perspective

### 1. **[[EHYEH|Ehyeh]] [[ASHER|Asher]] Ehyeh → “As He Is”**

- In Exodus 3:14, God says _Ehyeh asher Ehyeh_ — “I WILL BE THAT I AM.”
    
- You’ve shown this as a **prophecy of Incarnation**: the Father (First Ehyeh), revealed through the Spirit (Asher), manifest in the Son (Second Ehyeh).
    
- John echoes this: _“As He is, so are we in this world.”_
    

- The eternal “I WILL BE” (Father) has become the “I AM” (Son).
    
- And now, astonishingly, that Name is extended into us: _we are as He is_.

### 2. **Name as Relationship → Love Perfected**

- You argued that God’s Name is not syllables but **relationship**.
    
- 1 John 4:17 says love is “perfected with us” — meaning the relational essence of God (His Name) is now embodied in us.
    
- To bear His Name is to bear His love. As Israel was “called by His Name,” now believers are **manifestations of His Name** in the world.

### 3. **[[YESH|Yesh]] – [[HASHEM|HaShem]] – [[KAVOD|Kavod]] Triad → Our Identity**

- **Yesh (Being):** God’s existence shared with us.
    
- **HaShem (Relational Name):** Our identity tied to His.
    
- **Kavod (Glory):** The manifest weight of His presence in us.
    
- 1 John 4:17 is the fulfillment: _“As He is (Yesh, HaShem, Kavod), so are we in this world.”_
    

- We inherit being (ontological participation in Christ).
    
- We embody relationship (children, heirs, friends).
    
- We manifest glory (His kavod through love and presence).

### 4. **Burning Bush → Cross → Us**

- At the Bush: God says, _“I WILL BE.”_
    
- At the Cross: Jesus says, _“It is finished.”_ The “I WILL BE” became “I AM.”
    
- In us: John says, _“As He is, so are we.”_ The Name is now **incarnated in His people**.
    
- The trajectory: **Promise → Manifestation → Participation.**

## ✨ The Name of God in 1 John 4:17

So when you say _“The Name is relationship,”_ 1 John 4:17 is the New Testament’s confirmation.

- The Name is not distant. It is **perfected love**.
    
- The Name is not abstract. It is **embodied in us**.
    
- The Name is not just God’s identity. It is **our shared identity with Him in Christ**.
    

---

## 🔑 Key Takeaway

Your perspective sees the Name of God as **Father, Son, and Spirit in relational self-giving**. 1 John 4:17 declares that this Name is now **embodied in us**:

- As He is (the Burning Bush “I AM”),
    
- So are we (the living manifestation of His Name),
    
- In this world (His kavod made visible through our love).

This means your theology of the Name finds its climax here: **the Name of God is not only revealed in Christ—it is perfected in us as love.**
