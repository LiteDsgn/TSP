A **sermon arc** that ties **Exodus 3:14 → John 1:14 → 1 John 4:17** into one seamless narrative. This is the _Promise → Incarnation → Participation_ storyline you’ve been building.

# **Sermon: The Name That Became Flesh**

---

## 1. **The Promise: Burning Bush (Exodus 3:14)**

- Moses asks for God’s Name.
    
- God replies: _Ehyeh [[ASHER|Asher]] Ehyeh_ — “I WILL BE THAT I AM.”
    
- Not static existence, but **dynamic promise**.
    
- God is saying: _“I will happen. I will show up. I will be for you what you need.”_
    
- The Father (First [[EHYEH|Ehyeh]]), through the Spirit (Asher), promises manifestation (Second Ehyeh).
    
- **Word-Bite:** _“God’s Name is not a definition—it’s a promise of presence.”_

## 2. **The Incarnation: Word Became Flesh (John 1:14)**

- Centuries later, John declares: _“The Word became flesh and dwelt among us.”_
    
- The Greek _egeneto_ = “to happen, to come into existence.”
    
- What God promised at the bush—_“I WILL BE”_—John proclaims as fulfilled: _“He became.”_
    
- Jesus is the Second Ehyeh, the visible face of the invisible God.
    
- **Word-Bite:** _“The God of the Bush became the Man of the Cross.”_

## 3. **The Participation: As He Is, So Are We (1 John 4:17)**

- John takes it further: _“As He is, so are we in this world.”_
    
- The Name is no longer just revealed in Christ—it is **perfected in us**.
    
- We don’t just call His Name; we **bear His Name**.
    
- We are children, heirs, friends, beloved—living manifestations of His [[KAVOD|kavod]] (glory).
    
- **Word-Bite:** _“The Name is not only spoken—it is lived through us.”_

## 4. **The Triad Fulfilled: [[YESH|Yesh]] – [[HASHEM|HaShem]] – Kavod**

- **Yesh (Being):** We inherit existence in Christ.
    
- **HaShem (Name):** We embody relationship—called by His Name.
    
- **Kavod (Glory):** We manifest His weighty presence in love.
    
- 1 John 4:17 is the climax: _“As He is (Yesh, HaShem, Kavod), so are we in this world.”_

## 5. **Practical Application**

- When you forgive, you manifest His Name.
    
- When you love, you carry His kavod.
    
- When you walk in integrity, you reveal His yesh.
    
- The world doesn’t just hear God’s Name from your lips—they see it in your life.
    
- **Word-Bite:** _“The Name of God is proven not by theology, but by love.”_

## 6. **Conclusion: The Name Lives in Us**

- Exodus: _Promise_ — “I WILL BE.”
    
- John: _Incarnation_ — “He Became.”
    
- 1 John: _Participation_ — “As He is, so are we.”
    
- The Name is not distant. It is relational, incarnational, participatory.
    
- **Final Quote:** _“God’s Name is not a password to heaven—it is His presence in you, perfected in love.”_

You’ve shown that the Name is not syllables, but **relationship, being, and glory**—fulfilled in Christ and embodied in us.
