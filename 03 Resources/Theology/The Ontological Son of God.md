# The Ontological Son of God

If we are looking for a verse that says, _"God has an eternal, ontological Son who is of the same essence as Him,"_ in explicit, systematic terms: **No, the Old Testament does not state it that clearly.**

However, if we are looking for passages that **describe a Son** in a way that goes far beyond a functional human king—attributing **divine nature (ontology)** to him—there are two or three specific texts that theologians point to.

Here are the strongest instances where the Old Testament hints at an **ontological Son**:

### 1. Proverbs 30:4 – The Creator’s Son

This is arguably the most mysterious and "ontological" reference to a Son of God in the OT. The writer is asking a series of rhetorical questions about who created the universe:

> _"Who has ascended into heaven, or descended? Who has gathered the wind in His fists? Who has bound the waters in a garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth?_ **_What is His name, and what is His Son’s name, if you know?_**_"_ (Proverbs 30:4)

- **Why this suggests Ontology:**
    

- The context is **Creation**. Gathering wind and binding waters are things only Yahweh does.
    
- The text puts "His Name" (Yahweh) and "His Son's Name" on the same level regarding the mystery of the Creator.
    
- It implies the Son was present/involved in the establishing of the earth (which aligns with the New Testament claim in Hebrews 1:2 that God made the world _through_ the Son).
    
- Unlike David or Solomon, this "Son" is linked to the **act of creation**, not just the **act of ruling**.
    

### 2. Isaiah 9:6 – The Child Who Is "God"

While this verse speaks of a child being born (humanity), it attributes titles to Him that are strictly ontological (Divine).

> _"For unto us a Child is born, Unto us a Son is given... And His name will be called Wonderful, Counselor,_ **_Mighty God (El Gibbor)_**_, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace."_

- **Why this suggests Ontology:**
    

- The title _El Gibbor_ (Mighty God) is used in the very next chapter (Isaiah 10:21) to refer to Yahweh alone.
    
- No functional human king (like David) was ever called _El Gibbor_. They might be called "gods" (_elohim_) in the sense of judges, but never "Mighty God."
    
- This bridges the gap: The "Son" given is ontologically the "Mighty God."
    

### 3. Psalm 45:6-7 – The King Called "God"

This is a royal wedding psalm, but it addresses the King in a way that blurs the line between human and divine.

> _"Your throne,_ **_O God (Elohim)_**_, is forever and ever... Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You..."_

- **Why this suggests Ontology:**
    

- The writer addresses the King _as_ Elohim.
    
- While we established earlier that judges/rulers can be called _elohim_ functionally, the context here says this King's throne is **"forever and ever."** Human kings die; this King reigns eternally.
    
- Hebrews 1:8 quotes this specifically to prove that Jesus is ontologically superior to angels.
    

### 4. Daniel 7:13-14 – The Son of Man (The Divine Human)

While the title here is "Son of Man," the description is Ontological Deity.

> _"I was watching in the night visions, and behold, One like the_ **_Son of Man_**_, coming with the clouds of heaven... Then to Him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom... His dominion is an everlasting dominion."_

- **Why this suggests Ontology:**
    

- **Riding the Clouds:** In the OT, _only_ Yahweh rides the clouds (Isaiah 19:1, Psalm 104:3). By riding the clouds, this "Son" is claiming the prerogative of Deity.
    
- **Worship:** He is given a kingdom that will not be destroyed, and all nations serve/worship Him.
    
- This is the text Jesus used to get Himself convicted of blasphemy. The High Priest knew that the "Son of Man" in Daniel was a divine, ontological figure, not just a human prophet.
    

### Summary

The Old Testament operates on **Progressive Revelation**. It does not start with a full Trinitarian theology. instead:

1. It establishes that God is **One** (Deuteronomy 6:4).
    
2. Then, it introduces a mysterious figure (The Angel of the Lord, The Son of Man, The Wisdom of God) who seems to be **distinct from God** yet **identified as God**.
    

So, while there is no single verse that says _"God has an ontological Son,"_ Proverbs 30:4 and Isaiah 9:6 provide the pieces of the puzzle that only fit together if the Son is, in fact, ontologically God.
