# The Vice-Regent who is Yahweh

That is an excellent catch. It is very important to define terms precisely here, because "Vice-Regent" can sound like "Agent" if we aren't careful.

When I used the term "Divine Vice-Regent" in the context of Daniel 7 and ancient Jewish theology, I was **not** saying Jesus is less than God.

I was describing the **Trinitarian Paradox** that exists in the Old Testament.

Here is the breakdown of why being the "Vice-Regent" in Daniel 7 actually proves He **is** God, rather than just a created servant.

### 1. The Problem: The Invisible vs. The Visible

In the Old Testament, there is a tension:

- **God is Invisible and Transcendent:** No one can see God and live (Exodus 33:20). He is the "Ancient of Days," often pictured as sitting on the ultimate throne, above all.
    
- **God Acts Visibly:** Yet, throughout the OT, a figure appears who talks like God, accepts worship, and leads Israel.
    

### 2. The Solution: The "Vice-Regent" who is Yahweh

In ancient Near Eastern culture, a Vice-Regent (or Vizier) acts with the full authority of the King (think of Joseph and Pharaoh in Genesis 41).

However, in the Bible, the figure who acts as God’s "Vice-Regent" is unique. He isn't just a representative; He carries the **Name** and **Nature** of God.

- **Exodus 23:20-21:** God sends an Angel (Messenger) to lead Israel. He warns them, "Do not rebel against him... for **My Name is in him**."
    
- **The Implication:** To have the "Name" of YHWH "in" you means to possess the authority and essence of YHWH.
    

### 3. Why Daniel 7 Proves Deity (The "Cloud Rider")

In Daniel 7, the "Son of Man" approaches the Ancient of Days (The Father).

- **The Action:** He is given "dominion, glory, and a kingdom."
    
- **The Result:** "All peoples, nations, and men of every language **worshiped** him." (Daniel 7:14).
    

**Here is the "Deity" Key:**If Jesus were merely a created "Vice-Regent" (like an angel or a human agent), God would be committing a sin by giving Him this role.

- **Isaiah 42:8:** "I am the LORD; that is my name! **I will not yield my glory to another.**"
    
- **The Logic:**
    

1. God says He will _never_ give His glory/worship to a created being ("another").
    
2. In Daniel 7, God gives His glory/worship to the Son of Man.
    
3. **Therefore, the Son of Man cannot be "another." He must be included in the Divine Identity.**
    

### 4. Summary: Distinct Person, Same Essence

So, when we say "Divine Vice-Regent" in this context, we mean:

- **Functionally:** He is distinct from the Father (He approaches the Ancient of Days).
    
- **Ontologically (Nature):** He is God (He rides the clouds and receives the worship that belongs only to God).
    

**How to explain this to your opponents:**

> "When Daniel portrays Jesus as the Ruler acting for God, it doesn't mean He is less than God. It proves He _is_ God.
> 
> Why? Because the Old Testament is clear: God does not share His glory with created beings. He does not allow creation to worship agents. The fact that the 'Son of Man' rides the clouds and receives eternal worship proves that He shares the uncreated nature of the Father. He is the visible Yahweh interacting with the invisible Yahweh."

In short: Only God can be the Vice-Regent of God, because the universe is too heavy for a creature to hold.
