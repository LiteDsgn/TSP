# The theological threads of Christ

It is not textually possible to provide a specific verse for every single book (like Philemon, 3 John, or Esther) that explicitly uses the exact phrases "Son of Man" or "Son of God."

However, we **can** trace these three specific theological threads—**His Divinity (God)**, **His Sonship (Son of God)**, and **His Humanity/Authority (Son of Man)**—across the major movements of the Bible.

Here is how those three specific identities appear throughout the Scriptures.

---

### 1. The Thread of Divinity: "Jesus Is God"

_This thread traces the moments where Jesus is identified as Jehovah (Yahweh), the Creator, or fully Divine._

**The Law ([[TORAH|Torah]])**

- **Genesis:** He is the **Creator** (Elohim) involved in the "Us."
    
    "Let **us** make mankind in our image..." (Gen 1:26) & "In the beginning was the Word... and the Word was God." (John 1:1)
    
- **Exodus:** He is the **"I AM"** (Yahweh).
    
    "I AM WHO I AM." (Exodus 3:14) — Jesus claimed this title in John 8:58: "Before Abraham was, I am."
    

**The Prophets**

- **Isaiah:** He is the **Mighty God**.
    
    "And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, **Mighty God**..." (Isaiah 9:6)
    
- **Jeremiah:** He is **The LORD (Yahweh) Our Righteousness**.
    
    "This is the name by which he will be called: The Lord Our Righteous Savior." (Jeremiah 23:6)
    
- **Micah:** He is the **Eternal One**.
    
    "...whose origins are from of old, from ancient times [everlasting]." (Micah 5:2)
    
- **Zechariah:** He is **Yahweh Pierced**.
    
    "They will look on **me** [Yahweh speaking], the one they have pierced..." (Zechariah 12:10)
    

**The Gospels & Acts**

- **John:** He is **God the Word**.
    
    "In the beginning was the Word... and the Word was God." (John 1:1)"Thomas said to him, 'My Lord and my God!'" (John 20:28)
    
- **Acts:** He is the **Lord** whom Paul prays to.
    
    "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit." (Acts 7:59) — Prayer is directed only to God.
    

**The Epistles**

- **Romans:** He is **God over all**.
    
    "...Christ, who is God over all, forever praised!" (Romans 9:5)
    
- **Philippians:** He is in **Very Nature God**.
    
    "Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage." (Philippians 2:6)
    
- **Colossians:** He is the **Fullness of Deity**.
    
    "For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form." (Colossians 2:9)
    
- **Titus:** He is our **Great God**.
    
    "Our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ." (Titus 2:13)
    
- **Hebrews:** The Father calls the Son **God**.
    
    "But about the Son he says, 'Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever.'" (Hebrews 1:8)

### 2. The Thread of Relationship: "Jesus is the Son of God"

_This thread traces the unique relationship between the Father and the Son, moving from prophecy to realization._

**The Old Testament (Prophetic Sonship)**

- **2 Samuel:** The **Promised Son**.
    
    "I will be his father, and he will be my son." (2 Samuel 7:14)
    
- **Psalm 2:** The **Begotten Son**.
    
    "The Lord said to me, 'You are my son; today I have become your father.'" (Psalm 2:7)
    
- **Proverbs:** The **Mysterious Son**.
    
    "Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what is the name of his son?" (Proverbs 30:4)
    
- **Daniel:** The **Fourth Man**.
    
    "The form of the fourth is like the Son of God." (Daniel 3:25 KJV)
    

**The New Testament (Revealed Sonship)**

- **Mark:** The **declared Son** at baptism.
    
    "And a voice came from heaven: 'You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.'" (Mark 1:11)
    
- **Luke:** The **Son** by conception.
    
    "So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God." (Luke 1:35)
    
- **Matthew:** The **Son** revealed by the Father to Peter.
    
    "You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God." (Matthew 16:16)
    
- **Romans:** The **Son** appointed by resurrection.
    
    "...and who through the Spirit of holiness was appointed the Son of God in power by his resurrection..." (Romans 1:4)
    
- **1 John:** The **Son** as the source of life.
    
    "Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life." (1 John 5:12)

### 3. The Thread of Identity: "Jesus is the Son of Man"

_This was Jesus' favorite title for Himself. It connects His humility (humanity) with His absolute authority (from Daniel 7)._

**The Old Testament (The Vision)**

- **Psalms:** The **Son of Man** crowned with glory.
    
    "What is mankind that you are mindful of them, human beings [lit: son of man] that you care for them? You have... crowned them with glory and honor." (Psalm 8:4-5, applied to Jesus in Hebrews 2).
    
- **Psalms:** The **Son of Man** at God's right hand.
    
    "Let your hand rest on the man at your right hand, the son of man you have raised up for yourself." (Psalm 80:17)
    
- **Daniel:** The **Cosmic Judge** (The key text).
    
    "There before me was one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven... He was given authority, glory and sovereign power." (Daniel 7:13-14)
    

**The New Testament (The Fulfillment)**

- **Matthew:** The **Homeless Human**.
    
    "Foxes have dens... but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head." (Matthew 8:20)
    
- **Mark:** The **Servant Ransom**.
    
    "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve..." (Mark 10:45)
    
- **Luke:** The **Seeker of the Lost**.
    
    "For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost." (Luke 19:10)
    
- **John:** The **Bridge to Heaven**.
    
    "You will see 'heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on' the Son of Man." (John 1:51)
    
- **Acts:** The **Standing Savior**.
    
    "Look... I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God." (Acts 7:56)
    
- **Revelation:** The **Risen Ruler**.
    
    "I saw... someone like a son of man, dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest." (Revelation 1:13)
    

### Summary of Differences

If you are looking for a specific attribute to study, here is the distinction:

1. **"Is God"** focuses on His **Nature** (He is uncreated, eternal, and worthy of worship).
    
2. **"Son of God"** focuses on His **Relationship** (He is distinct from the Father, yet of the same essence).
    
3. **"Son of Man"** focuses on His **Mission** (He represents humanity, suffers for us, and returns to judge us).
