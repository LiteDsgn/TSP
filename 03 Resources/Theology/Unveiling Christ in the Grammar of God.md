# Unveiling the Hidden Messiah in the Burning Bush

### Introduction: The Question That Changed History

We often view the encounter at the Burning Bush as a moment of high philosophy. Moses stands before the Creator, trembling, and asks for a name. The answer he receives—_Ehyeh [[ASHER|asher]] Ehyeh_—has stumped scholars for centuries. It is usually translated as a static, immovable declaration: "I AM WHO I AM."

But I have been looking deeply at this text, and I believe we have missed the heartbeat of the verse. We have treated it as a definition of God’s power, when it is actually a revelation of God’s heart.

When I look at the Hebrew, specifically the structure of the sentence, I don't just see a solitary God defining His existence. I see a relationship. I see a prophecy. I see the presence of God revealing the Son.

Let’s unpack the saying in Exodus 3:14.

### The Hebrew Mind vs. The Greek World

To truly understand this name, we have to strip away our modern Western thinking and step into the sandals of a Hebrew nomad in 1000 BC.

We tend to think like Greeks. We ask, "What is God?" We want a definition of His state of being. But the ancient Hebrew mind was not concerned with _definition_; it was concerned with _action_. To them, existence wasn't a static state; it was an event.

The root word for "I AM" is _Hayah_. It implies "to fall out," "to happen," or "to become." Furthermore, the word _Ehyeh_ is in the imperfect tense, which implies unfinished, ongoing action.

Therefore, while "I AM" is a valid translation, a more dynamic and literal rendering is **"I WILL BE."**

Suddenly, the verse shifts from a static state of being to an active promise.. God is not just telling Moses, "I exist." He is telling Moses, "I will happen. I will take place. I am moving toward you." He is telling Moses that He is not a statue to be worshiped, but an Event to be experienced.

### The Mystery of _Asher_

The phrase is structured like this: **[[EHYEH|Ehyeh]]** — **Asher** — **Ehyeh**.

Most translators treat the Hebrew word _Asher_ simply as a conjunction—"who" or "that." But I see it as something far more profound. _Asher_ is the hinge. It is the connector. It is the relational bridge between two identities.

If we view this grammatically, we have a relation between two "I Am"s.

1. **The First _Ehyeh_:** The Source. The Unseen Father. The "I WILL BE."
    
2. **The _Asher_:** The Connection. The Mirror. The Revealer.
    
3. **The Second _Ehyeh_:** The Manifestation. The Son. The "I AM."
    

I believe _Asher_ serves as a prophetic window. It suggests that God’s identity is not solitary confinement. God is self-relating. The Father projects Himself through the connection of the Spirit to reveal Himself as the Son.

When God says, "I WILL BE **THAT** I AM," He is making a prophecy: _I will become in history what I have always been in eternity._

### The Prophecy of the Incarnation

This is where the theology becomes breathtaking. If we read Exodus 3:14 as "I WILL BE," it effectively becomes the first announcement of the Incarnation.

God is telling Moses that He is too big to be contained by a name, but He is loving enough to be contained by a promise. He is saying, "I will be for you what the situation demands."

- In Egypt, I will be the Deliverer.
    
- In the Wilderness, I will be the Bread.
    
- And ultimately, in the fullness of time, I will be **Flesh**.
    

If we read this through the lens of the New Testament, Exodus 3:14 becomes a prophecy of the Incarnation. The invisible God (The Father) is promising that He will be manifest. The "I Am" of Eternity is preparing to become the "I Am" of History.The structure holds the secret:

- The First Ehyeh is God in Heaven.
    
- The Asher is the bridge of the Spirit and Prophecy.
    
- The Second Ehyeh is the Son on Earth.
    

God is declaring: "I will be [in flesh] exactly who I am [in Spirit]."

The "Asher" is the mechanism of this revelation. It is the Spirit of God weaving the Divine into the human story.

### The Trojan Horse of John’s Gospel

This interpretation explains one of the greatest mysteries of the New Testament: The writings of John.

John was a Hebrew thinker writing to a Greek world. The Greeks believed God (the _Logos_ or "Mind") was perfect, distant, and unchangeable. The idea that God could change or touch human flesh was repulsive to them.

But John takes their word—_Logos_—and fills it with the Hebrew meaning of _Ehyeh_. He writes: _"And the Word_ **_became_** _flesh..."_ (John 1:14).

The Greek word used for "became" is _egeneto_—it means to happen, to come into existence. John is verifying the prophecy of the Burning Bush.

- **Exodus:** God says, "I WILL BE." (I will happen).
    
- **John:** The Apostle says, "HE BECAME." (He happened).
    

The "Asher"—the relational bridge—was no longer just a concept; He was a Man we could touch. The "Active Breath" of God at the bush became the "Living Flesh" of Jesus. God did not just send a message; He _became_ the message.

### The Echo in the Gospels

This interpretation is not just speculation; it is confirmed by Jesus Himself. In John 8:58, Jesus stands before the religious leaders and drops a theological atomic bomb:

> _"Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was,_ **_I am_**_."_

Jesus steps into the structure of Exodus 3:14. He claims to be the realization of the "I Am." He was telling them, "I am the fulfillment of the Burning Bush. I am the Second Ehyeh standing before you. The Asher—the relational bridge—has become visible."

- The Father is the "I Am" in heaven (The Source).
    
- Jesus is the "I Am" on earth (The Manifestation).
    
- They are One.
    

In Jesus, the "I Will Be" finally became "I Am." The God who was distant and fiery became a man who could be touched, heard, and known. As He told Philip in John 14:9, "Whoever has seen me has seen the Father." Why? Because the nature of the First "I Am (Source)" is perfectly revealed in the Second "I Am (Manifestation)."

### Did Moses Know?

Some might ask, "Are you just reading backward, or did Moses really understand all this?"

I believe he did. The New Testament tells us in Hebrews 11:26 that Moses _"considered the reproach of_ **_Christ_** _greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt."_.

How could Moses suffer for Christ thousands of years before Jesus was born? Because Moses understood the Name. He understood that the figure in the bush—the "Angel of the Lord" (Exodus 3:2,4) - was the visible Person of the Godhead. Jesus Himself said, "Moses wrote of me" (John 5:46).

Moses understood that the God who said "I WILL BE" was promising to come down. He understood that the deliverance from Egypt was just a shadow of a greater deliverance to come. Ehyeh asher Ehyeh was not just a name to file away in a library; it was a mechanism of salvation. He saw that God’s very nature is to reach out, to bridge the gap, and to save.

### Conclusion

So, when we read Exodus 3:14, let us not just see a high and lofty God who defines Himself. Let us see a God who shares _Himself_.

**"I WILL BE THAT I AM"** is not a riddle to confuse us. It is a love letter to pursue us.

It is the Father saying, "I will not remain hidden."

It is the Spirit saying, "I will bridge the gap."

It is the Son saying, "I will be the face of God for you."

The God of the Bush became the Man on the Cross. And because of that, we don't just worship a "Supreme Being." We worship a Father who sent a Son, revealed by the Spirit. So that today, we can know Him by name.
