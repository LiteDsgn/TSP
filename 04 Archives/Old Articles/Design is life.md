# Design is life

Every design is a life,

A function apart from this design is no life lived

Or better put, it's a life put to abnormal use.

  

The Life of the original design.

Many live ignorant of this life.

Hence, the need for the gospel.

A call to the reality of the life of our endorsed authentic and original design.

  

The real function.

Living apart from the real function is ignorance of what is.

  

"During our honeymoon in January, 1979, in the Blyderiver Canyons in Mpumalanga, South Africa, Lydia and I met a nature conservation officer who told us of a fascinating incident when they released a black eagle a week prior that had been in the Pretoria Zoo for ten years. She told us how excited they were when the bird finally arrived in its wooden crate. This was the day for this eagle to be freed and to return to the life of its design. But their excitement soon turned to frustration when, after opening the cage, the bird refused to fly! Ten years of caged life seemed to have trapped its mind in an invisible enclosure! How could they get the eagle to realize that it was indeed free? No amount of prompting and prodding seemed to help. Then, after some hours the bird suddenly looked up, and in the distance they heard the call of another eagle; this was the moment of true freedom! Immediately the zoo-eagle took off in flight! No flying lessons are required when truth is realized!" - Francois Du Toit
