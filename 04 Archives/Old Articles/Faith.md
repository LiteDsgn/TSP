As much as the world of science depends upon the senses to perceive, measure and calculate the facts to then form reliable conclusion, faith perceives the reality of God and extends the evidence to reason. Faith is to the spirit what your senses are to your body, while the senses engage in the fragile and fading, faith celebrates perfection.  Faith is not wishful thinking; Jesus Christ is the substance of faith. He is both the author and conclusion of our faith. He is the accurate measure of the blueprint of our design.

  

He is not hiding in history or in outer space, or in the future! He is I am in you!

  

Anticipate the revelation of Christ within you. There is no greater motivation for studying Scripture! Jesus did not point to the sky when he gave the address of the kingdom of God; he said, “The kingdom of God is within you” (Lk 17:21).
