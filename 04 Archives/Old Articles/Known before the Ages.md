# Known before the Ages

God has found us in Christ before he lost us in [[ADAM|Adam]]. He associated us in Christ before the foundation of the world (Eph 1:4 ).

  

He has always known us; now in Christ he invites us to know ourselves even as we have always been known (1 Cor 13:12)

  

Jesus Christ is the context and meaning of Scripture; his work of redeeming the image and likeness of God in man is what the Bible is all about (Col 1:13-15).
