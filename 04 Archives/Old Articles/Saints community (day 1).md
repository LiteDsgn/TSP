Heb 11:1 - 3, 12:1 - 2, 4:12 - 14, 1:1 - 3.

  

# When we look to Jesus, we see faith perfected.

# in hebrews 3,Christ is referred to as an apostle and high priest of our possession. Heb 2

  

At the right hand, we see Jesus as our high priest, he offers sacrifice for sins. Heb 5:1, 7:21 - 25. He's our security. He's our assurance.

  

Eph 1:16-19, 23. 2:1 - 5

  

#at the right hand, we see ourselves on him. His finished works.

  

Titus 1:4, Rom 1:16... Common faith, mutual faith. We have received all that Christ has done for us. Phil 1:6.

  

Eph 4:11 - 16... Points us to the fact that God gave gifts to men.

  

To hope for is to be expectant. I must keep thirsting and coveting the things of God.

  

1 Cor 14:39,

  

We desire to "not have" because we already have but because we want to "function in them".

  

1 Tim 4:13
