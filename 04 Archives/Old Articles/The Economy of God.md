He represents the entire human race. In the economy of God, Jesus mirrors humanity. The heart dream of God realized in the redemption of man; in one man, through one act of righteousness, in a single sacrifice, he rescued the human race!

  

The conclusion is clear. It took just one offense to condemn mankind; one act of righteousness declares the same mankind innocent. The disobedience of the one man exhibits humanity as sinners; the obedience of another man exhibits humanity as righteous (Rom 5:18, 19 The Mirror).

  

We see then, that as one act of sin exposed the whole race of men to judgment and condemnation, so one act of perfect righteousness presents all men freely acquitted in the sight of God (Rom 5:19 J.B. Phillips).
