# The Mirror

Instead of an instruction manual, the Bible is a mirror revealing our redeemed identity.

  

We are not window-shopping the promises; we gaze into the mirror of our true likeness and discover the integrity of our redeemed innocence.

  

Any form of striving to become more like Jesus through personal devotion and diligence, no matter how sincere, bears the same fruit of failure and guilt.
