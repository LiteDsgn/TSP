# The Power of Divine Faith God's Belief and Our Salvation

When we seek to unravel the profound mystery of our salvation, we must first turn our gaze towards the faith of God. Divine faith, the profound belief held by God, has been instrumental in scripting the narrative of salvation. It is the engine that drove the event of resurrection, the cornerstone of our Christian faith.

  

The scripture in Ephesians 2:8 announces, "Ye were saved by grace through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God." The grace referenced here speaks to the monumental act of Christ's resurrection from the dead - a triumphant victory over sin and death. But how did this act come to be? It was made possible through faith. However, we must remember, this is not the faith of man, but the faith of God Himself. (Col 2:12)

  

It was God's unwavering belief in the resurrection of Christ that brought it to pass. The God who speaks things into existence, who commands light to shine out of darkness, believed so thoroughly in the resurrection of Christ that it indeed occurred. This remarkable event was not the result of chance or arbitrary power but the outcome of the persistent, fervent faith of God. It is His faith that breathes life into the dead, both in a physical and spiritual sense.

  

Now, where do we, as mankind, fit into this narrative of divine faith and grace? We are the beneficiaries of this magnificent work. When we hear the gospel, we are not initiating a new transaction with God. Instead, we are informed of a transaction that God has already made before time began. We hear about the faith of God, about the grace given to us, and our role is to see, understand and live in this truth.

  

The faith we have is birthed from hearing about God's faith. When we hear about God's belief in the resurrection of Christ, it sparks faith in us. This faith does not create or contribute to our salvation; it merely allows us to comprehend and accept the salvation that God has already achieved for us through His faith.

  

In conclusion, the essence of our salvation lies in understanding the interplay of God's grace and His faith. It was God's faith that orchestrated the resurrection of Christ (grace), and it is this same faith that births belief in us when we hear the gospel. We are thus forever encompassed in the ambit of God's faith, forever partakers of His grace. Indeed, our salvation is not of ourselves; it is, and always will be, the gift of God.
