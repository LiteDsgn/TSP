# The Power of One Life Understanding the Bible Through the Lens of Adam


     

## Understanding the Bible Through the Lens of [[ADAM|Adam]]**

Hey there! I wanted to share some thoughts with you about the concept of One Adam and how it relates to our understanding of the Bible.

  

According to my interpretation, Adam represents the corn of wheat, the seed that fell to the ground and died in order to bring forth life (John 12:24). This is a metaphor for exiting the Garden of [[EDEN|Eden]], leaving behind the Divine Self/Awareness and descending from above, into the realm of sin and ignorance. Romans 5:14 states, "Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come." This passage reinforces the concept that Adam represents one life, one entity, one seed that sets the stage for the coming of Jesus Christ, the Last Adam.

  

But just like a seed that dies and brings forth new life, Adam also brings forth fruit - in the form of the Last Adam, who continues the seed's journey and brings us back to the garden. This is a metaphor for resurrection, returning to the Divine Self/Awareness and ascending back to the High Estate. The Apostle Paul speaks to this idea in his teachings in Romans, where he talks about how the seed falls to the ground and dies in order to bring forth life. This same concept is also found in 1 Corinthians 15:45, where Jesus is referred to as the Last Adam, who brings forth new life through his resurrection.

  

I know this might sound confusing, but bear with me. What I'm trying to say is that we don't need to do anything to return back to Eden as individuals. The concept of One Adam, Jesus Christ, has already returned back to Eden with and as us. We were in him and as him when he did. We are in the realm and glory of Life. We are in the Divine Self/Awareness. All we need to do is know this and remember it.

  

This idea is supported by scripture, such as Romans 6:5, which states "For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be in the likeness of His resurrection." The concept of One Adam, Jesus Christ, is key to unlocking the deeper meaning behind the Bible's teachings. It reminds us that we are all connected and that we can return to our true, divine nature if we only remember who we truly are.
