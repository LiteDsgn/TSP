# There is no difference

There's no difference in what the traditional leaders of old did and the religious leaders of the new do. There is just a change from a small angry god to a big angry God. My God is bigger than your god.

  

They both continue to try pleasing an angry God. Both continue to walk blindly in their darkness (ignorance). Their own opinions of who God is. Hence, they feed people with fear and continue to keep them thirsty.

  

This is not who God is, and this was why Christ died. They fail to realise there is only one God and Father of ALL and in ALL. There was need for a show of how full we are in Him and how in love He is with us. Awesome relationship not needed to be feared. For fear is unreal. Christ the priest, came to show us our fullness in His love that we should thrist not anymore. That we should stop living to please a pleased Father. Our priesthood is one of the same kind. We live and proclaim, to others, the fullness of who we are to Him.
