The destiny of the [[LOGOS|Logos]] was not to be caged in a book or a doctrine but to be documented and unveiled in human life! Human life is the most articulate voice of Scripture. Jesus is God’s language; mankind is his audience (Heb 1:1-3).

  

Diligent research and study is not the key to understanding the Scriptures; Jesus says, “You study and search the Scriptures thinking that in them you will find eternal life, but if you miss me, you miss the point.”
