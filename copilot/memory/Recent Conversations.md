**Time:** 2026-01-27 22:48
**Summary:** The conversation explores how to discern willing giving from a "physics" perspective, focusing on the trajectory of resources and the source of flow. It then analyzes 2 Corinthians 8 and 9, explaining that Chapter 8 lays the theological foundation for generosity (why we give, rooted in Christ's grace), while Chapter 9 details the practical mechanics and "agricultural laws" of giving (what happens when we give, leading to multiplication and worship). The AI concludes that true generosity is an overflow of recognizing our wealth in Christ, resulting in predictable multiplication and circulation of resources.
